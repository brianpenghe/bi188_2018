Human genetics and genomics

* papers to read coming out soon
  * 4 recommended
  * more available
  * users guide to the human genome     
    * entry into world of genome browsers (detailed walk through)
      * given sequence find all the information about the gene.

* gene expression analysis
  * trade off between quantity and quality
    * microarray lots of quantity, qt-pcr high quality only few genes
  * microarray (ron davis, caltech alum, )
    * 2d array that provides semi-qantitive data
    * affymetrix array
      * built by growing short nucleotides about 25 bp, n(ever made in
        own lab)
      * features very similar between chips
        * allows making comparisons between chips
    * spotted array
      * can use any dna on it
      * fewer features needed than affy, but can only put fewer down
      * always done in ratio

* phylogenetic ordering (hierarchical clustering)
  * treeview
    * calculate pierson correlation coefficient between two data
      points
    * red = higher expression, green = lower expression
    * works nicely for fewer genes, helps with being intuitive
  * clustering does help increase the perceived order

* tumor cell lines
  * know of oncogenes and tumor supressors
    * modified in germ line or somantically to change odds of getting 
      cancer
    * several cancer types cluster together ( published 2000 )
      * melanomias, colon, leukemia, renal (kidney) group together
      * breast, prostiate, non-small lung are scattered around the tre
      * published in 2000 not so comprehensive
        * focused on genes expressed in large quantities by adult
          cells. Need to be done ove rwhen as our knowledge of the 
          genome and genes increases
        * based on 1100 genes showing the greatest signal
   * breast tumor array analysis
     * single tumor that was sampled at detection and after chemo is
       more similiar to itself than to other tumors
     * clustering can be overdriven by other
     issues. e.g. vascularization

* chip array (ChIP/chip) 
  * different combinations of transcription factors are...
  * beta test, tool to compare ChIP/chip data
  * Chromotan IP
    * put epitotpe tag after promoter?
    * take cell douse in formaldehyde
      * crosslinks proteins to proteins and proteins to dna
    * chop dna up to fragments of about 100 bp 
    * lyse cells open
    * PCR amplify dna fragments (random primed amplification)
    * put sample and control onto ratio array containing promoter and
      regulatory sequence (at least hopefully)
    * gets neighborhood, not specific nucelotides
  * ChIP/Array (Lee, Rick Young)
    * half transcription factors of yeast
    * triplicate measure of cells in log phase growth
      * estimated aobut ~30% false negatives, ~10% false positives
        * missing some interactions, implies bogus connctions
      * worked around it using a strong P value (.0001)
    * shows pictures of resulting predicted interaction maps
      of various qualities. (some missing additional interactions)
    * shows summary of cell cycle regulation
      * which regulators are attached to which gene
      * used peak in microarray timecourse to predict when regulator
        was attached to gene

* titus, talks about FRII
  * HW makes more sense as it is linked as web page
  * used to look at genomic dna between human, mouse, rat
    or human vs chick.
  * tool is useful to find regulatory regions
    * look for comparison between genomes.
    * tools are actually used.
  * two projects Myf5 or Sox2
    * myf5 
      * 
    * sox2
      * early midline regulator in chick
  * using FRII, tutorial on page.
    * two sequences, connects all points of similarity between
      sequences with a line 
    * FRII can handle 3 way comparison (Mussa is more)
      * can force requirement that there's a connection between all 3 
        sequences
      * shows myf5, with a large number 
    * reverse compliment match shows up in bp view

* Homework
  * due date for paper, 
    * ID human gene, chosen by me, looked at from genetic and genomic
      view.
      * what happens when mutated in human & model organism
      * need to be somewhat knowable
      * omim website, good introduction to human diseases
        * can be somewhat out of date
        * omin is starting place, but can be 
      * papers 2 pages are too short, and 
      * 5-6 pages to explain why gene is interesting and what kind of
        experiment should be done
      * should include figures
      * recommended 6-10 pages with some figures
    * plagerism == bad, make sure you properly footnote websites
    * reference crucial facts
      * look at real science pages
    * mid may due date
    * turn in paper electronically on monday
