Dr. Wold lecturing

papers being mailed out for reading

users guide to the human genome - entry into world of genome browsers with very detailed step-by-step walkthrough 

start w/ sequence info, find out everything you can get out of those data browsers

go do the test case, get familiar

underlying theme for today: gene expression analysis

which genes are expressed in which situation?  how much expressed?

tradeoff in gene expression studies: quantity over quality 
e.g. microarrays give a lot of information, but maybe it's not as high a quality

relative expression data, not completely linear over the range of RNA

'''slide: overview of affy & spotted arrays'''

variety of ways to look at and process gene expression array data

typically done with gene chip that represents all the genes in an organism

'''slide: readout from a small chip w/ a few thousand genes'''

hierarchical phylogenetic tree clsutering vs. "real" clustering with cluster boundaries 

reasons why both are useful, so might want to do both 

tree doesn't handle all the genes in a genome well 
but ordered by tree helps


'''slide: yeast analysis'''

there is data from early studies on yeast for normal cell cycle, 
spoprulatation, heat stress, and other conditions 


'''slide: 60 tumor cell lines, partial microarray analysis'''

Ross et al, Nature Genet. 2000

grouping of major subgroups of cancers, 
how similar the different tumor cell line (conditions) are

note distribution of breast & non-small-cell lung

breast, prostate, & non-small-cell lung & carcinomas
all different in that they're distributed around the tree

this was a kind of old study, a problem: dominated by highly-expressed
adult genes so missing TF's & cell surface receptors that are
key in cancers, so conclusions: redo all early studies to get closer
to the answer!


'''Slide: top 1100 genes showing the most signal (via preprocessing)'''


'''Slide: single tumor type, breast tumor array analysis (perou et al example)'''

main lesson: 2 tumors from same subject will be a lot closer to each
other than any 2 between individuals (a single tumor collected 2 times,
detection in surgery, & another during chemo),

there are specific cell type kinds of cancers, e.g.: stromal cells,
ductal carcinomas, etc.

large scale gene analysis and what you get out of it


'''slide: ChIP / Array (chromatin immunoprecipitation (aka "chrimatin IP") 
via microarray readout) Lee et al. 2002'''

related large-scale measurement, only recently feasible

regulator proteins that regulate genes and the genes they regulate

instead of 1-10 gene operation as in the past
do it globally, computational algorithms to make connections 

happens in prokaryotes a bit, happens in eukariotes a LOT, 
combinatorics of multiple regulators needed to regulate a gene 

chromatin IP - a good antibody for a protein of interest to you, antibody for a factor X.

  * fix them with formaldahide
  * crosslink proteins / proteins and proteins / dna

if you do it well, at the right level, then you have a factor of 
interest connected to dna, pluck out protein & attached DNA
use polymerase to make more copies of that DNA in particular 
and assay it somehow

purified away from the rest of the genome
that band should come up more strongly than no antibody or 
wrong antibody

this approach, assay with PCR primers, 1 gene at a time
effective, but boring since 1 gene at a time

instead, use generic amplification
e.g. ligated PCR, ..., etc.

pull out your antibody and the control material that came out with 
the non-specific antibody

after cross-linked and enriched, chop up the DNA into pieces, 
pretty large, a few hundred bp long, getting small is a problem
not surgical determination of which nucleotides a factor binds to
(ideas for the future, not how it works now)

first run at a global study (done at MIT by Lee, rick young) 
done in yeast, 1/2 of transcription factors, 

~30% false negatives and ~10% flase positives with P=0.001 as threshold

cataloged those above-threshold, ~4000 interactions
usually low number of regulators bound, e.g. plot from 1 -> 12
don't expect it to be very high, so the numbers make sense, "not too bad"
number of promoter regions bound
(underestimating by a bit), not surprising that the most dominant 
group are a small group of genes.
also true that a small group of genes (20-50) can affect the results


'''Slide: regulatory network connections revealed by the analysis'''

tinker-toy building blocks

circles are transcription factors, boxes are targets (genes) which produce 
transcription factors 

autoregulation, multi-component loop, feedforward loop, single-input motif
multi-input motif, regulator chain

feedforward loop 
mcm1 regulator functions in more than one phase of the cell cycle
-> SWI4 gene -> SWI4 factor -> CLB2 gene

represents simultanaety, or if both occuring in 1 cell at the same time, 
not sure

the regulator chain shows exmaple of lots of cascading control, 
observed frequently in developmental

''question:'' chain to amplify? B: yes, but not the only way, while the shown
modules/connections exist, there are other inputs (not shown) as well,
so the chain is not necessarily subject to just 1 kind of signal


'''Slide: yeast circle plot of cell cycle regulation/control'''

models are only as good as their inputs, so incomplete, but still 
lots of connections did get made

didn't use a sample organism per time point per regulator 
instead, if you have good temporal data, ...


'''Slide: chris hart's PCA cluster expression groups '''

infer time course of factors


=== Sequence comparison ===
second 1/2 - Titus Brown

Davidson lab

intro to s/w for doing seq comp to pull out & identify functional elements

beta testing for newly revised FR
part of thesis work

tell us what's understood (and how) about that gene
when mutated in human and in model organisms

expecting you to state in e.g. the final 3 paragraphs 
what really matters about the gene, and what 

pdf or word files, kill no trees, electronic submission

talk w/ tracy and/or Barb and/or Stew
to make sure everyone doesn't pick distrophin
or genes about which so little is known
has to fall in a reasonable range

=== Midterm project information ===

OMIM web site - online mamillian inheiritance in man

intro to individual genes and human genetic disorders related
though some are out of date, some has been superceded

look for nice blue references, that's a starting point
to find genes of interest to you
friends/family affected by polymorphism in the gene
free with motivations

5-6 or sometimes more pages in length, 6-10 pages including bibliography

figures generated by you (or at least referring to a figure) 
that's highly relevant

I want to be real clear, some people this far, sophmore -> grad students, confusion about plagarism
regarding the web, copying off the web is plagarism even if not a
journal. also to just change a few words of a paragraph

dark moment explaining to a junior that an effectively copied 
paragraph was plagarism, 

serious about it and sharp enough to pick it up

also serious about references, crucial facts, and studies you are citing, need to be referenced

doing it for all kinds of reasons, though slow reading at 
first, not expected to master the content as a grad student 
in the field would, but to at least be exposed.
