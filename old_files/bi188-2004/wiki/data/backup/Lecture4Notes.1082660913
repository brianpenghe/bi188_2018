Microbial genetics 

pyrmidine biosynthetic pathway
[[br]]needed in the urea cycle in yeast

-> CP -> VS -> DHO -> O -> OMP -> UMP

CP = carbonyl phophate - two subunit enzyme

complex regulation of CP in bacteria

consider example pathway, 
and its conservation of this pathway across diverse genomes

yeast, bacteria, human - some cases only 1 enzyme needed, vs. 2 or more enzymes to do the job
in some cases enyzmes produced are similar but the regulation varies 
  dramatically 
also: yeast has 2 genes for lots of things- later we'll explain why

also explained that genes can fuse

gene fused in human
fused poly-peptide
rudamentary-like locus
making small wings

famous locus in drosophila, rudamentary, makes small wings 
missing 1st 3 enzymes in the chain

3rd step in chain is not functional in yeast
structure is conserved, but not doing anything

looking at diverse organisms is more challenging because 
there is so much biochem diversity

trees constructed witih ribosomal rna sequence 
typical 60% identity from 1 yeast gene to human 
trees constructed witih ribosomal rna sequence *may* not apply to 
your particular gene

switch gears, to larger scale, genomes

bacterial genome organisation
textbooks not showing the diversity of microbial world that truly exists

e.coli K12 circular dna chromosome 

lots of secondary metabolism
some are 2x length of e.coli, up to smallest fungal genomes
often variation of size

bacterial genomes need not be circular

best linear ... lymes disease - hairpin ends
others linear without hairpin ends

animal virology strategies for end of chromosomes
alternates to telomeres

barillia (sp?)
plasmids, 20 kinds, extra 60% more coding 

species w/ more than 1 chromosome

what's a chromosome in bacterial word?
ribosomal rna genes, essential functions, housekeeping genes

eukaryotes, linear is the norm
big advantage: reciprocal combination, 

bacterial, prokaryotes
odd crossovers lead to multiple centromeres, problems

normally bacterial have 1 copy of info 
ecoli, theta type replication, 2-4 copies of dna seq 
normally, maintain 1 chromosome

dinococcus
near nuclear reactors, radiation resistant
stationary phase, multiple copies of chromosome
survive double-strand breaks, templates to repair them
they're the exception

genome duplication 
[[br]]more than 1 chromosome
segments, whole genomes, what?

organism: rhodobacter
fully sequenced
photosynthetic bacterium
2 chromosomes, + 5 small plasmids
3.2MB, 0.9MB
but also lots of duplicated sequences, 
within chromosomes & between chromosomes
how? look for exact duplicated sequences that did not diverge
lots of short ones, how long on average? interchromosomal, 
duplications are quite a bit smaller, so older.
intra-chromosomal duplications are newer. 

[double check inter vs. intra above]

2 kinds of trees produced
type a's tree a bit different than type b
X is that gene in another related species
ancient chromosome association vs. recent duplication within chromosomes 
you see 35/44 are type A
so has had 2 chromosomes for a long time
also GC content on both is quite similar, etc.
they look similar
bacterium evolved differently from e coli, maintaining 2 sizeable 
chromosomes that are essential for their function

though most bacteria don't do this, this one does

what do you need to make an organism grow?
micoplasma genetalium
580KB genome, smaller than e coli
gc low organism
470 genes (estimate at the time)

e coli, 4.6MB

how does genome get small?
throw out lots of metabolism
can't synthesize nucleotides or amino acids
gene families start to compact

e coli family factors has 4
this has 1

1 operon for ribosomal rna, 
missing parts of 

does have lots of transporters to bring them in from the environment
price: bring molecules into cell

pathogen, repeats involved in surface antigens, 
thrown away lots

buchnera
related to e coli but small genome
antisymbiums of insects
live inside incect cells in symbiotic 
~600KB but details don't matter
strategy to shrink genome
does have essential amino acid pathways, and feeds them to the host
some it doesn't bother to make things it doesn't need
making essential amino acids
limits to metabolism 

buchnera lives in e.g. an aphid
other antisymbiums live in e.g. termites

dnaA missing
rac A, bacterial recombination, missing 
why disposing of function... 

different thatn typicall bacteria
synchronize with host cells
recombination not essential anymore once hanging out 
inside another cell, not many chnaces to do recombination
does have rec repair , not rec A

shared set of genes is now low 300's

what's present int mycoplasma, buchnera, down to low 200's, 
PRETTY SMALL NUMBER!

nanoarchaeum (paper on web site)
small genome, 490KB
symbiotic relationship with hypothermaphile, called ???
metabolism is GONE
some dehydrogenase, 
may get energy from organism it's living with
looking at genome, it's very different from all other bacteria
in many ways

throw away things vs. very old deep branch on the phylogenetic tree
ribosomal proteins, scattered in this organism
hardly any operons at all
but has more genes, estimate 552
intergenic spaces smaller, packing them together

split genes, 2 separate poly-peptides
early biochem world might have looked like
maybe fused early-on
no pseudogenes here, everything's working
adaptation to a niche causes pseudogenes, being obliterated
NOT here.
computer software for finding trna genes
this software doesn't work well to find the full set of trna in this
offers interesting clues about early life


e coli in lab  K12
is non pathogenic, not virulent by any stretch of the imaignation
lots of e coli cause little/no harm

but there are others not like K12

0157:H7 - bad burgers!
pathogenisis
shows up other places as well
causes severe diarreah
toxin producing organisms

other e coli
europathogenic
live as harmless but encode to attach, up through 
urinary tract to bladder to kidneys cause systemic disease

e coli relatives
salmonella in lab, treated the same
but as pathogen, very different
invade cells, pass through, live in disseminated macrophages
salmonella typhae

chagella chagella, major element in dissentary

studied intensively in the lab, important disease org's as well

e coli early in sequencing project

K12 studied for years

looking at 0157, scientists expected to find small number of pathogen genes


4.1MB backbone sequence
1 inversion between 157 & K12, big invert, several hundred KB
extra 1.3MB of dna, K12 has 0.5 divergence
(are they the same species?)

genes in backbone are 98% conserved

lycogenic phage
explains large number of blocks coming/going in genome
islands, dna inserted > 50bases, 
in 0157 there are 177 islands, not just a few places that have dropped in

pieces all over the place!

0157 has genes that K12 doesn't produce, but what's the extra sequence?
how else are the organisms changing?  need change to live happily 
in host

3 genomes (salmonella, K12, 0157)
given 90% similarity of dna
find < 40% genes common between both!
pathogens, commensils, lots of need to explain these gene's function!

salmonella 4.8 MB
2 large plasmids w/ lots of pathogenesis genes on them
grow inside cells, resist death by macophages, etc.

salmonella typhae, (typhoid)
large number of pseudogenes, over 100, single stop, single frame shift

with chagella, a bit more distant relative
4.6 MB genome
large IS elements moving around
13 large rearrangements on backbone


break

gene order in distantly related organisms
essentally scrambled (to 1st approximation)

canda albicans
sacromyces
neighbors come together, reasonable 
but frequently 1 of the genes had been inverted relative to each other!

ignore not shared genes
just easy orthologs, where are they
gene on SC where on CA, 
lots and lots of little local inversions
contribute as much as big translocations

same phenomena described in many organisms

related genes may remain nearby but exact order and orientation 
may not be preserved

SC genome itself 
done chromosome by chromosome, 
large numbers of genes duplicated, often, blocks duplicated
not exactly in order (coming, going, etc)
find a bunch in order on SC chr 7.
over time, looked at reginos around centromeres, 
figured out which pairs go together
had to be 8 things instead of 16 things
many of the organisms in the SC branch also have 8 sets of chromosomes

pick another org in SC branch, 
completely sequence the genome, and compare
recent work with Ashbea (7 chr), and Klivermyces (8 chr)
in SC, early after diversion of species, number of chromosomes doubled
after duplication happened, many disappeared on 1 or the other of pair
now modern day pair of chromosomes, many genes only on 1 or other of 
pair of chromosomes, have to look for the occasional conserved pair

if you have one of the others to throw in the alignment, it becomes 
easier.  can't thow away from both chromosomes, can use Klivermyces
as guide to line up others, makes it easier

get more things, also get new things
another opportunity, given 2 copies of gene, 

2 copies do the same thing
impose differential regulation on them
fermenting vs. perspiring (at regulatory level)
also can change at primary sequence level, can have divergence

lots of examples of that
how many pairs to work with? high 5000 genes, 457 pairs to work with
of those, 76 

also can change the level of expression as well

look at the DNA level, to figure out what the genes in genome are doing

transcription arrays, correlate expression pattern, 
to look like gene of knwn function, implicate it that way

other strategies to figure these out

genes with unknown function, know nothing at all.  your unknowns look 
like others unknowns; 

proteomic approaches also, not discussing

know expression across large number of conditions is useful

analogous in DNA, whole sequence from many organisms can be very 
helpful as well... 

first, make a null mutant to see what the phenotype of the null 
mutant looks like

one-by-one, delete every gene in genome IDd by sequencing project

mark them individually to be indistinguishable when done
put in molecular bar codes, delete YFG1, replace with 
common sequences next to bar code sequences

hyb to microarray that has the ... 

fitness studies then use bar codes to deconvolve

6000 strains, put through different conditions 

standard rich medium

SC grows as haploid or diploid 
heterozygous, then sporulate them

what fraction of genes are essential? 1100

that experiment doubled the number of known essential genes

15% of viables had growth defects in rich medium, so some other problem

next, grow on rich or minimal media, antibiotics, whos groing 
faster, slower, etc.

yeast GAL genes studied to death, grow on galactose, large number 
of strains reduced fitness, not previous implicated in prior studies

amino acid biosynthesis

experiment added all sorts of stuff

implicated in particular processes, look at fitness vs. each other

interesting variant- grow as haploid or diploid and have available 
in heterozygous form

industry: find drugs that kill fungi, not many of them so far, 
not many ways.

Essential functions

haplo insufficiency

knockout in heterozygous forms, grown in presence of antibiotics, 
genes invovled in reduced fitness 

find target of the drug to better understand

only 1/2 genome avaialble, started trying antibiotics, 
which heterozygoes have reduced fitness in presence of drug

e.g. statins, get tthings in colesterol pathway
gives confidence in the method

most notable: phiphloroperimidines, sugar added if needed, 
kinased up into nucleotides, 

e.g. picked up CDC21, but MANY other genes, quite a shock, 
including many in processing of ribosomal RNA

can help explain side effects in humans

antifungal, find pathway that fungi have that humans don't


align whole genome
scoring for matches, mismatches, spacing between genes, gap 
penalties, 

once built up complete scoring system, build up orthologs

local region of genome with residual alignments

say you have operon in 2 species, but order is scrambled, 
not effective at finding that

relies on genes being in order
lots of limitations
works better on closely-related genomes
some useful predictions
mentioning as another way to deal with whole genomes

last way, most fruitful, avail of large number of genomic 
sequences... genomic profiling

supposed plot
y axis down, genes
x axis across top, species

hunt for orthologs

cluster genes across species pattern

works with large number of species
cluster rows, genes involved in same process
cluster columns, global taxonomy based on gene complements in systems

use same tools for microarray data to look at how genes are distributed 
across large number of genomes

in bacterial world, 50-100 sequences now
eukaryotes, number growing rapidly
in fungi, growing

caveats:
- decide what we're going to call a species
  - if doing taxonomy, lump closely related together and take union of genes

  - might vary what you mean by species in gene

- protein fused in single gene: 1 gene or several?

- work with orthologs, any homology, 

+/- reults, or scoring based on distance

many variations on the idea

but very powerful approach, used to look at human disease genes  
for genes of unknown function, in bacteria, to know more about the gene.

in eukaryotes, limited to small number of genome, so statistics not yet 
valuable.

take an ortholog found in more than 3 species (NIH group) 

clusters of orthologos groups (COGs)

buchnera, 99% of genes are in COGs

berillia, only 43% of genes are in COGs

need to see lots more genome sequences to fill in gaps and to get 
represented across speces before we're done

if 2 genes conserved across distantly related organisms
it's a good bet they're doing something similar

good complement to other approaches

microarray expression data, if a gene's expression doesn't change much, 
it wll be difficult to cluster

fitness & expression need not correlate
maybe not changing level of transcription, e.g. regulator. 

idea, use of multiple sequenced genomes is MUCH better!


tracy discussed project 

a bit of genomics known about the disease you pick

look in OMIM site, good, current site
list of genes involved in genetic disorder


pick one gene by next monday, email to Tracy

noone pick cistic fibrosis

use FR II to study

how long is paper supposed to be?
5-6 pages, don't go overboard

Cite ANYTHING you find, don't copy/paste off of web, 
that's standard honor code type stuff
