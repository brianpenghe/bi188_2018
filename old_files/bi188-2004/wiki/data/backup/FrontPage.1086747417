= Bi 188 Lecture Notes =

There are two sets of notes for each lecture, taken by two different people in class.  Notes taken by Joe Roden
are in a Wiki Wiki format.  These notes can be edited.  For more information on how to do this see HelpForBeginners.
If you find errors or want to add information to these notes, please do.  Some editing for spelling and accuracy has already been done.

The other set of notes is taken by Diane Trout.  For formatting reasons, these are available as text files.  

Both sets of notes may contain errors.  Remember, they are trying to type at the speed of the lecturer in class.  
They are meant only as a supplement to your own note 
taking in class.  When in doubt, trust your own notes or textbook or ask Tracy.
