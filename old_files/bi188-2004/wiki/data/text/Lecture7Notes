Dr. Wold presenting

* Gene therapy, difficulties with
  * Beta thalasima, Cycle cell, seemed like we had good solution using
    transfer 
    * tried to do the experiment in israel. 
    * took 25 years to get around to trying the experiment, but has
      had problems
  * Insertional mutagenesis
    * everything except for homologous recombination has chance for
      mutagenesis
      * disrupt gene
      * cis effects (disrupt regulation)
        * therapy for SCIDX1, solves immune problem while causing
          leukemia
      * homologous recombination works nicely in mice
        * recombination is inefficient in any model organism. 
          very low chances compared to random integration
          even in yeast you need to do a selection critera
          * ethical issues for humans
            * worldwide ban on germ line research
            * though its easier in the embryo than adult so perhaps we
              should reconsider germ line.
            * technically possible to do IVF and insert gene into
              blastocyst, select which one uptook the gene and then
              create new embryo from it.
        * many other cells will integrate it randomly anyway.
        * target cell access
          * need to access a large enough number of cells to uptake
            gene and provide a selection pressure to filter out the
            cells without the modified gene.
        * engineering apropriate place/amount of expression
        * permanance
          * if you miss the stem cell, the treatment will wear out
        * evading the immune system
          * presenting new protein can bring up immune response
            against targeted gene
        
[ Q: what about using bacterial symbiots to produce a replacement protein? ]


* Beta thalassemia gene therapy
  * old goal not realized, first work 1979
  * hematopoetic lineage is favorabel for gene therapy
    * self marrow transplants can be done well
  * getting gene expressed in physiological amounts in right cells but
    not others
  * LCR (locus control region)
    * operationl definition without a complete molecular definiton
    * site in DNA that covers 12 kb, has number of transcription
      factors, chromitin is permanently remodeled within the LCR,
      acts at a distance, on the order of 60 kb.
      * LCR seems to control the total amount of transcription,
        protects against position effects.
  * Lentiviral vectors
    * can only integrate into cell
    * though there's an issue about whether or not virus can recombine
      with a currently viable virus and make a new super virus
    * lentivirus has limitations on total payload size
    * cd34 seems to target largely hematopoetic progenitor cells
    * lentivirus can integrate into a cell that is not currently going
      through cell cycle, other retroviruses can't

* Gene therapy mediated insertional mutagenesic hazard
  * SCIDX1 severe combined imuni deficiency disorder
  * codes for gamma-c cytokine receptor subuniit comon chain in
    recepters for IL2,4,7,9,15
  * the retrovirus for this study was a mouse maloney vector
    * the LTR also codes to for something that encourages the gene to
      be shut down probably by chromitan remodeling
  * Trial was 11 and 8 months old
    * isolate CD34+ cells
    * get cells to start dividing in culture, (needed for the
      retrovirus)
    * infect repeatedly for 3 days with gammaC moloney
    * 3 year latency, 2 people developed lymphoblastoid leukemia
      T-cell leukemia
    * in both cases triggered LMO2 oncogenes
      * LMO2 is transcription factor of progenitor cells
  * retroviruses insert "randomly"
    * but have preferential neighborhoods
      * genes currently expressed
      * retroviruses like promoter region

* Triplet repeat diseases
  * went through several explanations of how they worked
    * increasing severity with progression of generations
  * molecular origins
    * putative replication slippage of repeats
    * huntingtons was expansion in a protein coding region
    * myotonic dystrophy
      5-38 repeats is normal
      39-100 is mild disease alleal
      disease alleles is up to 2000 for the most severe
