* Microbial organisms
* genome evolution

* perimidine synthesis
  1) make carbonate phosphate
  2) Uregna sustinate
     (alosteric enzyme)
  3) Dihydral oritate
  4) Oritate
  5) OMP
  6) UMP

different bacteria
  for step 2, catalytic subunits similar, regulatory region completely
  different, gets more different the further away you get.

DHO step 
  at least 2 different enzymes to solve this problem
  e. coli has human, yeast has completly different

Fused polypeptide for OMP and UMP synthesis

steps 1,2,3 have been fused for several other organisms
  though, in yeast, the part for step 3 is broken, and a different
  gene is performing the function

phylogenetic trees based on rhibosomal sequences

       human
       s.pomba
       neurospora/asperiglis
       candida
       sacromicies

Tree based on rhibosomal sequences may be different for your gene of
interest. There's horizontal transmission or something else.

Can construct a tree based on a larger set of genes

* Genomes

bacterial genome organization (textbooks simplified it)
  Usually think in terms the K12 ?
  genome size is quite variable even in related species

  lime disease bacteria has a linear chromosome with hairpins.
  (others don't have the hairpins)
    most plasmids add another 60% coding capcity (only a few are
    actually necessary)

  what is a chromosome in bacteria
    essential functions?
    rhibosomes?

Eukaryotes
  * linear useful for reciprocal recombination
    * linear safe for odd number of copies

* duplicate sequence? 
  * how did that happen?
    * bacterial world
    * rhodibacter photosynthetic
      * has 2 chromosomes, 5 plasmids
        1) 3.2 mb
        2) 0.9 mb
        duplicaton between chromosomes
        looked for exact duplication sequences
          * how long were they on average
          * intrachromosome are smaller "thus older"
          * inter chromosmoes are longer - younger
        paraloge genes
        type A - CI/X  CII  - anchient duplications
        type B - CI/CII X
          X - gene in related species
          CI/CII related gene on two chromosomes

* smallest bacterial genomes
  * mycoplasma 580 kb genome 1/8 e. coli
  * low G/C content, ~ 470 genes
    * very little metobolism
      has to get amino acids, nucleotides from the environment
      one operon for bactera
      has lots of transporters to import useful molecules 
  * Buchnera - endosymbants of insects
    * live in insect cells in symbosis
    * ~ 600 kb range
    * reasonably close to e.coli
    * makes essential amino acids for the host
      * put some aminio acids on plasmids to up gene dosage
    * ~ 300 between similar types of organisms
    * ~ 200 when compared to mycoplasma
  * nanoarchaerum
    * symbiotic relationship with thermophile
    * ~ 4[79]0 kb
    * unclear where it's getting energy
    * very different from all other bacteria
    * seems to be deep branch on evolutionary tree
      * very deep using rhibosomal protein
      * very few operons
    * small geneome but more genes than above examples 552
      * small intergenic regions
      * things that appear as single polypeptide in familiar organisms
        appear as two polypeptides here.
      * tRNA program can't find all the tRNAs

* e.coli genome "familiar"
  * K12, early selected for seqeuencing
  * O157:H7 "bad burgers"
    * causes severe diahrea
  * ureopathic 
    * live as commensals in gut, but contain genes to attach to
      urinary track.
  * salmenila different from e.coli
    * can invade cells, transmit as macrophages
  * shugella? disentery

  * looked to see what made O157 a pathagen hoping for small
    difference
    * K12, O157 share 4.1 mb "backbone", 98% identical at sequence level
    * O157 has unique 1.3 mb
    * k12 has 0.5 mb
    * lysogenic phages can add/subtract large blocks from genome
    * pathogenicity "islands" (>50 bp inserted)
      * O157 has 177 islands
        * has some genes for toxins
      * K12 has 234 islands
      
    * compare with uninary tract e.coli and compare
      * see Welch_etal02 pg 4
      * less than 40% are common between all 3 organisms

  * salmonila typhid
    * ~ 4.8 mb, + 2 large plasmids
    * large numbers of pseduo-genes, not just research strain
      * recent loss

  * shugella
    * 13 large rearrangements compared to e.coli.

* diploid organisms
  * sequence one or two copies of genome.
  * shotgun sequence whole thing and hope the assembler works it out
  
* Eukaryotic genes
  * Gene order
  * found many nearest neighbors when sequencing
    * except order might have flipped
    * many local inversions + large scale translocations
  * try comparing two closely related organism to sacromicies
    * sacromicies genome doubled, look for genes that are still
      conserved between two copies.

* how to figure out unknown genes in saccromyces
  * knock out YFG1 (your favorite gene 1)
  * use "molecular barcodes" to id organism
    * different short sequence surrounded by common sequence
      * PCR amplify common sequence and spot on microarry for short
        sequence
  * make mutants in heterozygote strains
    * can exist as haploid/diploid
    * 1100 essential
    * 15% of viables had reduced growth rate on rich media
  * Drug searching
    * using heterozygotes grow in antibotic media and look for reduced
      fitness 

* look for alignment between distant bacteria
  * operons give some help

* genomic profiling
  * using large number of sequenced organisms

             species (completely sequenced)

          X        X          X
 Genes  X             XX
             X X      XX

  Can cluster looking for genes that always show up together
  possibly find genes doing related things

  at least 50 completel genomes for bacteria

  what's a species?
    * union close species?
    * look at closly related species good for functional
  what's a gene? 
    genes get fused together, 
      * break them apart to find in each genomes

  * COG cluster of orthologous group
    * at least 3 species

  * berlius only 43% in COGs
  * genes conserved in distant organisms are probably doing something
    similar. 

* HW
  * pick genetic disorder by monday, email it to tracy
  * no cystic fibrosis
  * some work will be done using FRII
  * 5-6 pages, double spaced?
    * show each component as seperate discussion.
