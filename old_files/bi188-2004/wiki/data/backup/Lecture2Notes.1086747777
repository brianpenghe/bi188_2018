Tracy: 

handing out assignment next week
mck sequence comparison
to get familiar with blast, seq comparison, working with genomes

could be on your final, could have a sequence analysis question on your final
introduce you to the kinds of things that are important in working w/ genomes

Barbara: 

assignment's to get you to interact with genome browsers
use as a warm-up exercise, optional
it will be useful

in 1st hour: underpinnings of bio/data from whole genome analysis

last week: tools, algs, for seq comp; 2 classes of biology:
large general feaetures, base pair statistics; other is finding a 
gene, knowing when 1 gene/genome is an ortholog, where protein 
coding sequence is.

how you find the cis-regulatory elements that run genes and dictate 
where/when they'll be expressed

tried to get most recent paper on the human genome, rather than 
the paper from 2yrs ago, but couldn't
The mouse genome paper offers some comparison also.
another newer paper being written now, done by end of course, will 
give to you later

'''slide: reference genome sequences 4/03'''

mycoplasma (paracitic bacterium) 400 genes  (done)
it's the simplest/smallest self-conatined cell in terms of gene number

E. coli + 100    4.6 Mb  (done)

(Slides will be on the web!)

yeast  12.5 Mb  (done)
plus small intergenic info, operator sites, promotors, 
6300 genes

now 5 other yeast species done to lower quality

mustart weed, arabadopsis  (done)
classic model organism for plant development

worms 1 & 2: c. elegans, c. briggsae (less well),   (done)
17,000 genes 97 Mb

fruitfly 120 Mb  (done)
13,000 

mouse & rat  3000 Mb  (done)
30,000 

Human 3,300 Mb  (done)
23,000 genes (that are protein coding)   (maybe 22,500)

recently discovered it includes a large segment duplication, 
hard to deal with in sequencing, learning about why this happens

First draft of Chimp

chicken (draft)

sea urchin (almost draft)
highly polymorphic individuals can be utterly limiting
paternal & maternal chromosomes differ quite a bit
mismatches- due to different genes or 2 different individuals?

sea squirt, 25x coverage, still couldn't assemble the genome 
because it's too polymorphic

dog genome (draft in a few months)
went to trouble to pick inbred boxers, strains, an individual, 
engaging in ill-advised inbreeding, then selected least polymorphic 
of all, now the source of the dog genome.

Now looking for an elephant like that.
african less polymorphic than indian elephants??? (Barbara can't recall)
chosen based on relative polymorphism

chicken genome almost done


'''Slide: Genome Project History'''

The post-human-genome sequence era, go get genes


'''Slide: how human genome first draft was done (twice)'''

public strategy vs. private/celera strategy

public approach:

150-350 Kb BACs
bacterial artificial chromosome
mel simon, hiraki shazoya
recombination pathways, defeat them, 
origin of replication
generate vectors that can clone large (repeated) sequences
any novel recombination apparatus that sees all the repeats is 
going to get confused 

physical map, overlapping clones
(except for centromere) 
to get tiling path
whole genome, take each clone, chop into small pieces, 
sequence them, overlap them, put it all together

private approach:

500 base runs lots and lots of times, 5x coverage OK, 
10-15x coverage statistically gets you everything.

Then put together computationally all at the end

old approach: 
had the machines but didn't have the algorithms, but had the guy:
gene myers, ex caltech undergrad, had been thinking about the algorithms
$100M+ to buy the machines and get the system up and running

but how do you combine pieces that are smaller than length of repeat?
complicated decisions to make, 
use clones of differing lengths, to get enough info

500bp info, 
both ends, know how far apart they are, 
series that are 2Kb appart, or 10Kb apart, or 50Kb apart, 
can puzzle together things that are otherwise ambiguous

now, getting other genomes sequenced, the biggest challenge 
is polymorphism
(See notes above that I inserted within the "genomes sequenced" section 
on polymorphism issues)


'''Slide: Genome browsers'''

EMBL, UCSC, NCBI? etc.
lots of tracks of comparisons, 
lineups, other creatures related or orthologous
human, mouse, fugu (pufferfish) (cool for other reasons than sushi!)

maps of mRNAs sequenced, 
ESTs long piece of dna

e.g. enter name of a gene

interested in some gene by name, often takes to right place, 
but as often will take you to another gene with similar/related name

should instead enter by e.g. genbank accession number 

mouse genes & human genes sometimes given same name, different names, 

the rule is, if you want to go someplace with assurance, start with 
some sequence and blast it.
sometimes a name PLUS accession number.


'''Slide: Global CpG island survey'''

CpG islands are an interesting feature, look globally at genomes, 
within vertebrates, these CpG islands have some functional significance 

localized, highly enriched around the beginning of genes, 

while they may not define a part of a promotor, they do tend to localize 
near promotors

numbers/maps of cpg islands match genes pretty well
what happens with CpG islands is that they're the subjects of 
methylation, for making open or closed chromatin


'''Slide:  % of sequence that's coding:'''

3% of sequence is protein coding , pretty small fraction
thus a large fraction is introns, repeats, intergenic (including 
islands of regulatory info)

> 70% of yeast is protein coding, much more compact, but do have 
full splicing apparatus

> 45 % of human sequnece is repeated sequence

sequence length?

complexity of genes?

while one goes down, another goes up

repeats, long interspersed, short 
transposable elemetns

in mouse genome, 
still have lots of elaboration of repeat families
bouncing into new sites & joining mouse genome

humans things are slowing down, not adding repeats as rapidly

repeats hopping around is a mutagen


'''Slide: repeat incidence'''

used to identify functionally special reginos of the genome where
repeats cannot go

e.g. HoxD  (homeobox) gene cluster in human, 
not allowed to be invaded by repeats

hole in frequency of repeats is, probably important, i.e. gene rich


'''Slide: terminology'''

paralogous genes = Highly similar genes within a genome derived from a
common ancestral gene

e.g. histone genes, 
e.g. betaglobin genes, alphaglobin genes
also have some with no discernable paralog
(how related to declare a paralog vs. just related protein domains)
paralagous also implies similar kind of function


orthologous genes = "same" gene in two different genomes 

consider how to distinguish a true ortholog from .... where there has
been gene loss or .... power of choromomal position ... same
chromosomal neighborhood

one gene in same neighborhood, ortholog
if rearrangement then may be "at sea" about which of 2 is *the* ortholog, 
e.g. the superior blast sequence, unless curated

Homologous = 100% similarity as in small polymorphisms
% homology loosely = % similarity


'''slide: biggest human gene known  dystrophin = 1.4Mb hnRNA'''

skeletal muscle just below the membrane
muscular distrophy

mutated in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

Located in X
thus males are affected
the lead disease for telethon foundataion

2.4 M base pairs long, 
transcription occurs over the space of hours (sort of amazing)
incredibly large target, lots of ways to mutate it
some ways the gene doesn't care about
large insertinos/deletions in introns, make no difference
but lots of ways to stop it or cause disfunction


the mRNA for this is ~6000 bp long

Average human gene:
  * ORF on order of 450 AA, 1350 bases  including 
  * mRNA = 1600 bases  including 5' & 3' UTR
  * distributed over 30KB

gene rich domains, and gene poor deserts


'''Slide: complex gene anatomy - distant and multiple regulatory elements'''

regulatory elements can operate over ~100 Kb  and skip over gene X 
(or 2 or 3 genes away) 
to site e.g. between MRF5 and myf5

as well as simpler control of downstream gene control, MRF5 -> myf5

can't be sure about regulation over distances within 3-5 genes

Q: how regulation over 100Kb? 
DNA looping to transactivate by promoting formation and action 
of the proximal / initiator complex
how does it *know* how to interact with the gene 2 genes down the road?

1 or 2 now.... 
take 2 promotors and swap them, still works, preferential
(not all/none), additional specificity

(in *this* example case, all 3 of these *are* expressed in similar cells)

But... also multiple cases where gene x and mrf4 are exclusive in 
transcription patterns, from myf5, e.g. chromatin opening/closing  
methylation of CpG islands, can play a role

paper included, by stubbs people

Hu CHR 19, 
mouse genome, pull out all sequences corresponding to genes on hu chr 19
all these interesting papers that do agnostic genome scan start with 
everything on 1 chromosome: Y, 21, 22, 19
high numbers implies small chromosome
rather than e.g. 1 or 7 which are large

most gene dense chromosome
highest packing ratio of genes per unit length
chromosomes in other organisms: representatives of a number of 
complex gene families
protein coding genes that occur once per genome, large paralogous families, 
medium paralogous families

gene dosage to make the same protein

family of zink finger transcription factors, over 1000 of them, 
repressing expressors, all use co-expressor protein

also olfactory receptor family

t-cell receptors
all highly-represented on 19

(other creb-class zinc finger on other chromosomes, also olfactory on 
others)

1 sadd vomeronasal (sp?) receptor

degree to which synteny is operating

look at 1/2 of chromosome
color coded


Missing Slide: the interesting appearance of the junctions
not surprisingly at sites of repeated genes, multiply within 
a choromosome, semi-homologous mediators of chromosomal 
translocations, happen to have occurred in germ line, 
generating novel genes at the junctions

'''Slide: finding conserved elements, using to map conserved features'''

mussa (I presume) software we want to get into your hands
mouse/human

mouse/human/cat/dog/cow 70%

muscle-creatin-kinase (MCK) exons
one tiny green box, non-coding exon, 

output from interactive viewer designed to highlight conserved regions 

more user friendly than a dot plot

30 bp sliding window across a 30 KB region of MCK, "simple" gene

simple sequence repeats (only) masked

leverage protein coding part, disallowing frame shifts, etc.

cis-acting regulatory elements

trying to find other genes we're less familiar with, e.g. micro-rna's

(not sure ???)
black  complements
red reverse complements

lots of mammals "radiated" 80-100 M years ago
(mouse, human, cat, dog, cow)

by chance between 2 genomes, now across 5 resolve much more clearly

evolutionary tree is your friend in these comparisons, 
esp. if multiple species that are distant from your reference 
genome, rather than just 1

5-7 yeast genomes, 

release of dog will get nicer

understand the anatomy of a gene, 
silencer or enhancer
find candidate binding sites 
for transcription factors, enhancers, silencers

several occur
bunch of tiny features
becoming clear that 1 tf binding site 
not heavily selected against occurring randomly in the genome
used to be will find in front of genes you want, and not in other genes.
occupancy can be transient, or require multiple-factors, or more likely 
a mix of both issues

if in conserved domain, and binding, candidate factors, 
computationally infer what tf or combination are regulating 
a given gene without doing a bio experiment

you can infer / hypothesize, but may not be ironclad hypothesis
so still large role for confirmatory experiments

but still an enormous gift for comparative genomics


'''Slide: characteristics of protein coding genes in 3 genomes'''



fly, worm, human
moving in direction of more uniform, shorter exons, 
interrupted by large introns

prevailing idea: through differentioal splicing or 
transpositions, 
exon defines prote-prot interaction site, widely used 
site, ring-finger proteins, luceine zippers, sitting on a
single exon with ... on either side, big invitation if you put element 
into some other gene, to get p-p interactions that previously didn't 
exist

'''slide: low on short introns'''

'''slide: functional group distribution for protein coding genes'''

look across prokaryotes, esp. those out in the environment, 
pathways represented by bacteria, which live in which envoronment.

all eukaryotes, but out to include arabadopsis

???? 
high for us, low for others

also immunity and defense has big differences, 
human more elaborated t-cell b-cell recognition
can do sweep of funcitonal groups

'''Slide: recent duplications:'''

inter(red) and intra(blue) chromosomal duplications
positive positional bias for centromere and telomere... why?
concequences?

impression: positional biases / frequency dep. on distance to 
end of chromosome or centromere, no understanding of this fact.

some of these very recent duplications in human since chimp, 
are fodder for being interesting difference, are 
intra chromosomal , not inter-chromosomal 

how many genes (what fraction) are about being a cell, 
and have simpler requirement for having them.

.. say 30% of known human disease genes have an identifiable candidate
ortholog in yeast

this is higher than everyone predicted, (predicted approx 10% only)

but so many things like map kinase are in all of these species

'''Slide: conserved squence elements between mouse & human 19'''

repeated & varied over/over again 

'''slide: mouse mutation rate approx twice as high as human'''

for next week, read chapter 10 for background, and 11 will be relevant
soon also
