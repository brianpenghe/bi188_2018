<h3>General Notes:</h3>

<ol>
<li>There is no text that covers current content of the lectures well.  The
book and lectures will not be highly redundant.  The book is intended as 
background material for which you will be responsible.  For this reason, 
especially in the early part of the course, we recommend that you review the 
background chapters as early as possible with the aim of filling in parts you 
do not know.
<li>Most lectures will include additional reference reading from the literature.  These will accompany the lecture (distributed by e-mail or the course web site).  Most papers, with the exception of preprints, will be from journals accessible on-line.
<li>There will be a midterm project/paper and a final exam.
</ol>
