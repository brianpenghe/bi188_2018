''''Disclaimer:'''
[[BR]]  These notes are taken by Joe Roden who has been taking notes on his computer during class.  
Some editing has been done for spelling and accuracy by Tracy.  Nonetheless, Joe would like you to heed the following warning:

''These are the notes I took during class.
  Sometimes they're good notes.  Sometimes 
  they're not.  You shouldn't trust them as 
  much as a text book, lecturer, your notes, 
  or much at all... I'm sure there are errors, 
  ranging from simple misspellings on up to 
  getting the logic backwards in major points 
  of understanding.  I'm a CS guy, so I really 
  don't know how to spell many chemistry & bio 
  terms- my notes may be a fine source of 
  entertainment for many of you.  Enjoy :)''
