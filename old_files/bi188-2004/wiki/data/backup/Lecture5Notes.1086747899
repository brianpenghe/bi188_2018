== Bi 188 Notes  Lecture 5  April 26 ==

S. Scherer Lecturing

in 1st lecture, I incorrectly stated something, should have said:
[[BR]]CTAG underrepresented, thus is of interest

bacterial endosymbiants, live in gut cells, strange but true, not a lot more known

focus today: 
[[BR]]1st part: more genetics, less genomics
[[BR]]2nd part: human genetics, resistance/susceptibility to infectious disease

genetics, need 3 things:
[[BR]]missing any, causes problems

* mutants
[[BR]]* complementation testing
[[BR]]* linkage analysis

lots of people to work with
[[BR]]humans - diploid
[[BR]]people not nearly as outbred as they could be,
recessive mutations not to difficult to find,
mutants causing problems are "self-identifying" 
[[BR]] [ joe notes inverse, non-problem causing mutants, aren't self-identifying! ]

sub-populations, extensive family records, 
extracting linkage data not that bad given all the records

technology for human genetics is applicable for other genomes
[[BR]]plants - some are polypoloid

genetics of trees: not easy because of long generation time, 
some phenotypes not observed in a dish, rather in full-grown tree

large overlay of statistics
[[BR]]statistics started in genetic analysis
[[BR]]can't do all expts we'd like to do 
[[BR]]drosophila, can do lots of expts, 
lots of statistical methods used

bi-122, how much not much [ statistics ? ]

looking for genetic evidence to support your midterm project
* theta, recombination fraction
[[BR]]two markers, heterozygous at 2 loci
[[BR]]how many are crossovers, how many aren't 
[[BR]]theta varies 0 -> 0.5

* phase, are the haplotypes known?
[[BR]]marker 1   marker 2
[[BR]]2 alleles
[[BR]]heterozygous at 2 loci


  M1a  M2a

  M1b  M2B

observed, expected, log ratio 

LOD score


pedigree i

z (theta,i) = log base 10   ( f (i,theta) ) / ( f (i, 1/2) )

get as many parental as recombinants when unlinked

denominator: unlinked case

theta: proposed, that you'll test

apply some models, see what odds ratio turns out to be

is it dominant, recessive, penetrance, expressivity

you have some segregation data, 
[[BR]]For example, I  think theta should be 0.2, apply model to data, 
[[BR]]what's probablility of getting observed result given theta and model

pedigree when unlinked and take log ratio

really simple case: 

2 genes, and we know the phase,

hetero at both loci, go thru meiosis

m1a -> m2a

m1b -> m2b

f is proportional to theta^X ( 1 - theta)^Y

weighted coin toss

X would be how many underwent recomb event

Y how many prodegy did original retain

LOD score Z can be positive or negative

x 0 -> 0.5 ???

y f ???

if theta 0.5 LOD score has to be zero.

if genes unlinked in real life, and you try to apply model that says 
they're linked, get graph that looks like

{{{
    | 
    | 
----------
    |  /
    | /
}}}

otherwise:

{{{
    |   -
    |  / \
----------
    | /
    | 
}}}

max is at theta = x / (x+y)


if following 2 markers, or real world case

phenotype P
[[BR]]marker trying to establish linkage to, M

marker 2 types

phenotype P has 2 values A & B

double heterozygote, as before

from one individual, 
[[BR]]PA  MA
[[BR]]PB  MB

but don't know the phase
[[BR]]single generation of single family, one generation 

{{{
5  P_A   M_B
4  P_B   M_A
1  P_A   M_A
0  P_B   M_B
}}}

are they linked or not?

if assume correct, 1 recombinant and 9 parentals

take 2 possibilities for which are recombinants and which parentals, 
do both ways, and average them..

in case original was 
[[BR]]PA  MB  
[[BR]]PB  MB

more likely 9 Y and 1 X
[[BR]]but in case wrong, calculate the other configuration and average both

likelihood is a function of this configuration and the reverse
the more likely is going to give you a larger probability [ ali: frequency? 
might need to normalize to do the probability, just a technical point ], 
the unlikely gives you a bit.


dataset likely to be incomplete
for any individual

first marker
[[BR]]PA  M1A  M2A
[[BR]]PB  M2B  M2B

don't have all possible datapoints for doing this multipoint 

so likelihood becomes extremely complicated, 
and max likelihood is not trivial

another problem: phenotype may not be easy to score
[[BR]]flies with red eyes or white eyes, would be easy

otherwise: height & weight
cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
many continuous variables


graph
[[BR]]x : quantitative trait we're measuring
[[BR]]y : number of individuals


phenotype AA vs Aa vs aa
[[BR]]3 gaussians overlapping 

that's our model we're throwing into the system
in middle, quantitative trait, overlaps all 3 distributions

problem linke this in gene finding, don't know if intron, exon, etc.
use HMM to try to untangle what's going on

do the same: HMM for picking the combination, discover middle Aa 
as most likely

trying to predict data based on some model, 
comparing to the unlinked case

alternative: family, some progeny in next generation, 
share some piece of some chromosome
must have something in common

build up totally different way of probabilities:
[[BR]]there is no model at all (non-parametric, or model free analysis)

some locus must control the trait
near some marker that you can follow

parent 1: square, parent 2 circle (MA, MB) 
[[BR]]4 sibling kids

light circle
[[BR]]dark square: MA
[[BR]]dark circle: MB
[[BR]]light square 

only worry about the affected, don't worry about penetrance any more

what's degree of sharing at particular marker
[[BR]]observed degree of sharing 
[[BR]]expected degree of sharing 

divide it by the standard error you calculate for 

(obs - exp) / std err  (details complicated)

you get a score
which is different from Z score, 
it's on different scale

how many stdev you're distant from some value

all aspects of this, not just test 1 phenotype against 1 marker
to scan genome, will do several hundred markers
observe tails of distribution by chance
because so many repetitions of the test

generally accept models when LOD > 3, reject when LOD < -2
but gets more complicated 
following a pedigree
resessive 

if penetrance not 100%, if dominant mutation not seen in parent 
apply many models, see which gives highest LOD score
then adjust for applying model many times

LOD score says if done with various models

if do the other way, no model

if model OK, LOD score better
if model inaccurate, other way is better

software will spit out both

scores required with model free approach scores around 3 are suggestive, 
around 4 are more likely to be useful

need to know which kind of score are you looking at

Question: anova-like approach too ???
[[BR]]yes: look at contributions of part of model
or cross-validation approach
but ususally amount of data is scarce 

model: gene controlling trait is [ dominant? recessive? ... ]
plus penetrance

once following multiple markers simultaneously, math becomes 
fantastically complex, but 

maximum likelihood if try to follow all at the same time

couple-of-dozen individuals needed for mapping easy 1 gene case

genetic map derived from males vs. females, is different 
constructed from male vs. female meioses, is different
must be thrown into 

nice rule of thumb number..

key fact: how much recombination in human genome?
[[BR]]1 cM is about 1M bp DNA

when screening genome, use a couple-hundred markers, 
plenty enough 

3000 cM approx genome total

genome project
[BR]]1st thing the genome business has changed... 
not the phenotypes to follow, the problem is the markers, and where they are

simple sequence repeats that vary in length, 
enable to get arbitrary polymorphic markers almost anywhere you want them

find markers in family you're trying to follow

need variable repeat markers
polymorphic everywhere, 
uniformly spread around genome

2nd change: what happens when you get linkage?
how many genes are in that interval?  Most are known
if map gene to particular place, have list to look up what the candidates are
last part of finding favorite gene, final battle
narrowed to 1/2 million to 1 million bases, haplotype analysis, minus a [...]

3rd change: 

an example:  familial mediterranean fever

actually sequence the individuals to see what polymorphism, 
what's main issue
to decide if that's causing the phenotype or not?

people haven't been around long, mutations for
trait arose in background with some number of polymorphisms around
same linkage 

5 polymorphisms in a row correlate with phenotype, 
if founder effect, can try to
get more more data via unaffecteds from population 

in paper: mutations arisen independently several times

also, the biology: does the gene make sense for the phenotype you're observing

if polymorphisms not in coding region, now have lots of 
non-coding sequence to look through, pain to do

what's driving this, how common are they?
my disease is more common than your disease
usually depends on the population

what are the common human polymorphisms:


  * sickle-cell anemea  (betaglobin)

  * cystic fibrosis 3% heterozygotes in some groups

  * muscular distrophy, duschennes, male, X-linked

  * LDL receptor, south africa, heterozygote approx 1%

  * GDPDH 1st step  sometimes 10% polymorphisms!

  * hemachromotosis - brittain 10% polymorphic

why so high? 
[[BR]]when trying to get an allele increase
[[BR]]hetero or homozygous?  if selection only on homozygote:
[[BR]]knock down initially, but won't get rid of it
[[BR]]won't go up if rare allele

2nd half of lecture, what are the main selections acting on people?
in 21st century different

nutrition, infectious disease are main drivers
survive long enough to reproduce

some genes that are clearly implicated by these processes, 
some are suspect

with some rare genetic disorders, can analyze pathways in entirety 

[ class break ]

malaria - geographically distributed
correlate with where malaria found
multiple kinds
vivax, discuss less, different organisms

complicated life cycle, several stages in human
[[BR]]earliest: in liver
[[BR]]then red blood cell
[[BR]]sexual cycle completed [on the insect side ?]

malaria
[[BR]]HbS is easy to demonstrate
[[BR]]sickle-cell anemia
[[BR]]heterozygotes are resistent to effects of malaria
[[BR]]homozygous severe problem, so don't see many 

major cause of mortality in children
hospitalized adults genotypes

many many hemoglobin alleles, related to HbS in various ways
HbC, same residue, but different amino acid

experiment, want to demonstrate a particular allele of a gene 
is conferring disease resistance

what's the experiment going to look like?
[[BR]]in this paper, looking at all possible combined genotypes as well

HbS - we know about, not seeing homozygotes, won't discuss
[[BR]]HbC - 
[[BR]]HbA - wild type

hospital in Burkina Faso
so we have AA, AC, CC

what looking for in hospital:

Question: do these genotypes in malaria patients have same frequencies as 
  in general population?  Are they at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

(often done as a refinement) compare to other hospitalized patients
with another infectious disease

but problem, if allele 10% of population:

CC are 1% of the population, looking for change in that number
hope there's an effect on the heterozygous,

OR design an enormous study

they did the latter, and verified something was going on

to study CC homozygotes, put in thousands of people

reduced oxygen pressure in red blood cells

hemoglobin C is particularly interesting, theyr'e in reasonable shape, 
growth of HbC in this population, there's a variant in human population 
involved in resistance to disease, can see gradient in resistance, 
suceptability as you move away from malaria centers

G6PDH
[[BR]]first step in pentose shunt
where you see deficiencies, 
maps out areas where malaria is known

300 alleles of this, stunning
dozens of these risen above 1% in certain populations
[[BR]]point mutaions cause varying degrees of loss of function
[[BR]]x-linked disease, lots of stuff going on, 
sometimes in >10% but
in n. europe or japan, <1%
[[BR]]correlation hits you in the head

sensitivity to anti-malarial drug

cut level of enzyme down by order of magnitude
complete knock out causes severe anemia

mechanism for resistance
related to malaria
[[BR]]g6pdh makes NADPH in cell, so reducing potential changed
cells not stressed, this pushes them over the edge, but then cells are cleared
so clearing parasite as you clear the problem cells

another major area in human genetics, where there's a high degrees of
polymorphism

immunology, histocompatability locus, many many alleles of mhc

antigen presentation 

allele HLA-Bw53
[[BR]]hospital, control
[[BR]]severe malaria (west africa, common allele, not rare) 16.9%
[[BR]]mild malaria (clinic) 22.6%
[[BR]]mild controls (at clinic, not for malaria) 25.4%
[[BR]]healthy adults 26.4%

see change in allele frequency

typed for many markers, including class II antigen also

homozygotes rare


alphaglobin locus, normally 2 genes, deleted between tandem 
duplication, have 1 not 2, these are in type called alpha-plus thallasemia's
alpha-minus are mutants that are not making

alpha-plus making, just less of it.

affecteds vs. healthy population are different
but look at case controls, alpha-thallasemia protects against being 
in hospital, so doing other things as well.

maybe other advantages we don't know about, what the alpha-thals are doing in the beginning is not clear

many other genes, associations with malaria

duffy-blood-group-antigens, absent in w africa, 
protects against malaria

tnf alpha
[[BR]]cd40L

lots known about genetic variation and resistance in malaria

diseases:

cystic fibrosis, 
[[BR]]homozygotes have severe problem
[[BR]]heterozygotes are resistant to infections
 
some advantage to heterozygotes, the protein encoded at 
cystic fibrosis, is receptor used by salmonella typhi to 
enter cells

heterozygotes have greatly increased resistance to Salmonella typhi or typhoid fever
[[BR]]aren't getting typhoid fever was once getting 

receptor for pathogen
[[BR]]When get pseudomonas infections, usually get rid of them by internalizing the bacteria


suspected, not confirmed:

hemochromatosis
[[BR]]carrier rates approx 10% in some groups
[[BR]]gene linked to histocompatability locus, HLA
[[BR]]took forever to find this gene, although easy to map
[[BR]]people are storing too much iron, taking up way more than you need
[[BR]]iron load becomes deleterious
[[BR]]suspected it's a regulatory gene 
[[BR]]iron not soluable in nature, so organisms develop mechanisms to scavenge 
[[BR]]same gene causing too much iron uptake
[[BR]]iron exported from macrophages
[[BR]]many pathogens survive in macrophages, and can be disseminated there
[[BR]]macrophages in these people explain what's going on in plague? 
[[BR]]maybe causing iron to be exported from macrophages, then iron defficient macrophages could explain

familial meditteranean fever
[[BR]]clone a gene , mapped the gene 
[[BR]]common gene in meditteranean area
[[BR]]map location, take the rest of the way to finding the mutaitons 
that are responsible 
kind of thing you see looking at disease genes in the class project
[[BR]]people have fever at varying intervals of time, over and over again
some kind of infection going on - 
lots of the damage sustained during infection
immune systems collateral damage
destroy own tissue
laying down amyloid 
recurs over and over again
[[BR]]link to infectious process?
complement pathway, C5A, chemoattractant for white cells
people with this disease can't turn down this peptide, 
can't shut off inflamatory response correctly
low-grade infections of sub-clinical behavior, over and over again
overreacting, not underlying infection itself
[[BR]]lots of variability in disease, they had slightly different phenotypes 
probably different alleles
[[BR]]some mutant alleles, that is the wild type allele in other organisms; mutant is actually wild type version in other organisms, these organism keep it in a higher state of readiness
[[BR]]for our purposes, turning down the immune response is the thing to do 
other organisms decided not to do this, that is the amino acid sequence for other organismss

Question: maybe allele will disappear 
[[BR]]1/7 are carriers, not going away fast
from paper, it's arisen independently
complicated, don't know how frequent it was earlier
pathogen selection going on in background, interesting

switch from common diseases to rare diseases 
[[BR]]analyze pathways from available human mutants even though rare

complement pathway first, 
[[BR]]give 1 minute description of complement pathway, many proteins involved
complement, kill bacterial cells, 
activated 2 ways, 
 * IgM & IgG
   [[BR]][ pathway diagram: many proteins C1->C9, proteases, steps in cascade ]

 * Alternate pathway, repeating structures on surface of bacterial cells
  [[BR]]fraction of population missing the many many proteins in the cascade

fmf gene doing other things other than down-regulating the signals

people missing these proteins are interesting... get infections
[[BR]]missing key c3, they get diverse infections
[[BR]]missing pathway from IgG, get encapsulated (polysaccharide) bacteria 
[[BR]]missing alternate, get meningococal infections, e.g. Neisseria 
[[BR]]missing last c9, have almost no problems at all

signal out of c3, or e.g. c5: Strep makes protease for C5a, 
so for some we know what they do

protein NRAMP1 
[[BR]]natural resistance, macrophages
[[BR]]studied in mouse
[[BR]]resistance locus for lots of thigns, e.g. salmnonella
intracellular pathogens

Chediak-Higachi
[[BR]]lack of pigmentation 
[[BR]]beige locus in mouse
[[BR]]protein involved in intracellular protein sorting
[[BR]]causes numerous defects in cells
[[BR]]using mouse is the way in

white blood cells binding
shared subunit in 3 receptors,
LADS leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome

read marker biology text book
[[BR]]phagocytic cells, kill through free radicals, 
oxidative chemistry looks like...
[ reaction diagram ]
if you can't get this pathway off the ground, 
[[BR]]CGD: chronic granulomatous [sp?] disease
simple things like Staph cause huge problems

NADPH: make O2-, so get free oxygen radicals
[[BR]]SOD: most ALS is not inherited, but there is inherited form here
[[BR]]MP: making bleach, peroxidase

IgA: antibody in secretion, seems important because microbes 
like Neisseria and Strep have proteases for IGA, if human mutant 
not making it, not that big a deal

HIV: some people aren't going to get sick, exposed over and over
to the virus, but infection not getting established, not getting 
into the cells? Not getting far, not getting in
[[BR]]HIV is complicated, because it mutates during infection cycle
macrophage-trophic ones, early in process, receptor situation for 
HIV is complicated, receptor + co-receptor(s), some more important 
than others, cell lines and macrophages for people exposed but 
not infected, 32 bp deletion in a co-receptor

again a surprise, look in normal population (in paper, in Europe)
[[BR]]found allele is quite common in general population
also at hardy-weinberg equilibrium, conferring obvious advantage 
to its population at some point
[[BR]]found in prostitutes, drug users, and others with high-likelihood of exposure over 
long period of time but remain HIV-neg
[[BR]]note the allele not commomly found in africa or asia

finish up: different ways to be resistant to infection
immune system multilayered, rare genetic disorders, take out 
late complement steps, not a big deal, but move away from 
world of infectious disease, study heart disease, obeisity, 
etc. many genes involved in the process don't produce much 
of the pheontype

when constructing model for a complex trait, then go back 
to do mapping, hard problem, much more to be done.

S. Scherer: won't be back for 3 weeks
