<h3>Sequence Retrieval, Analysis, and Comparison</h3>

Individual proteins/mRNA can be retrieved from NCBI's
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi">Entrez</a>
Web site.
<p>
If you are looking for cross-species matches (i.e. orthologues) to
a particular protein/mRNA, you can also use NCBI's
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">BLAST</a> server.
<p>
The most useful way to obtain <b>genomic</b> sequence, however, is
probably not NCBI; <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">ENSEMBL</a>
allows you to search many of the available genomes for the genomic
region corresponding to a protein.  Note that chicken and chimp
are available as "pre-releases".
<p>
Once you have identified the genomic region(s) you want to analyze,
you should use <a href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/">RepeatMasker</a>
to get rid of repetitive and low-complexity sequence.
<p>
You can then do a comparative analysis with
<a href="http://family.caltech.edu/">FamilyRelations</a>.  Note that
there are some other programs out there that also do comparative
analysis -- most notably <a href="http://pipeline.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/gateway2">Vista</a> and <a href="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/pipmaker/">PipMaker</a>.
<p>
<b>Please note</b>: if you're using FamilyRelations, please use
the <a href="http://chabry.caltech.edu:7000/canal/">public Cartwheel
server, Woodward</a>; choose the Bi188 lab area on that server.
You will also need to
<a href="http://family.caltech.edu/download.html">download</a> a
new version of FRII.
