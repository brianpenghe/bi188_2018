* mobile elements
  or how does a conserved genome get randomized.

  * learned about transpons through mutations that have unsual
    characteristics
  * transpons are everywhere, you can't help but finding them
  * genome project shows the complete catalog of all the transpons
  * how does a dna sequence move?

    * site B helps determine type of event
      * B can be special sequence limiting sites involved
      * B could also be missing allowing events at many places

    * what's a switching system vs a ? system

      * states switch more frequently than could be possible via mutation
      * could be a number of states
      * example Salmonella

        * changes antigen possible on flagella
        * inverted repeats of 14bp

           it switches promotor back and forth to control which
           direction it reads to control expression of H2 or unlinked H1

           another organism switch structural gene around

      * best studied: yeast mating type

        * 2 states \alpha and A

      * some systems vary genes among different
        individuals
      * some clever organisms can switch their surface protein to
        defeat your immune system.

        * selection for switched protein once the immune system has learned to
          recognize the first protein
        * Neisseria (one that causes gonorrhea)
        * relapsing fever Borrelia

          * has dozens of potential surface proteins

        * similar in African Trypanosome

          * perhaps a thousand, like Borrelia, out near the telemere
          * inserts an unusual base into the DNA "J"

        * malaria elaborate switching systems

  * transposable elements

    * DNA transposons

      * those that replicate

        * example: TN3 in bacteria

      * those that "don't" - the excise in process of moving -
        "cut-n-paste"

        * most eukaryotic Tns use this method

          * DNA moves out, leaving a hole, however other diploid copy 
            can repair the hole

    * RNA intermediate

      * Transposons
      * Retroviruses

    * issues:

      * how dependent is the transposon on the host cell?
      * how does it regulate itself so that it doesn't overwhelm the
        host and kill it.
      * can it promote its own expression, does it require "good
        fortune" for there to be a promoter when it lands
      * TY1 element of yeast

        * just like retrovirus but doesn't have an evelope protein, so
          doesn't leave the cell
        * hard to study, rare events

          * in "higher organisms" may only happen in specific cell types
          * how to test to see if it uses an RNA intermediate
            * insert an intron
          * up the frequency to see it happen?
            * stick a regulatable promotor in the front
          * test to see if it's hapened?
            * when it lands it can bring a  gene under its regulation
          * another technique

            * put gene in backwards with a forward intron
            * reverse transcriptse chops out intron, dna copy turns
              it back into intact gene

    * how does the organism fight back against the transposons?

      * c. elegans well studied

        * mutator strains have elevated mutation rates
        * detour to talk about RNAi - double stranded rna interference
        * some mutator strains were also defective in RNAi 

      * Neurospora ( almost no repeated sequence )

        * has at least 3 different systems to block repeated sequences
        * vegetative growth, has process "quelling"

          * lower threshold for quelling by overproducing rna
            dependent rna polymerase

        * MSUD - meiotic supression of unpaired dna

          * if genome has a sequence that is unpaired with other copy
            in the other copy of the genome which causes that locus to
            be supressed, it also supresses other chromosome
            locations.

        * RIP - name changes as understanding of phenomenon changes

          * repeat induced point mutation 
          * inserted genes were heavily mutated after cross

            * up to 30% of sequence mutated from GC -> AT
            * happened after mating before meiosis
            * appears to be methylation using secondary system

    * mammilian systems (name copies, % of human genome)

      * LINEs 850,000 21% of genome

        * retrotranspons but without terminal repeats
        * instead of using tRNA priming, perhaps just nick the genome
          and start RT on the polyA
        * frequently doesn't fully copy, sometimes part of it gets
          inverted
        * L1 is probably still active, and some can still replicate
        * have preferences on where they want to go
        * excess of line elements on X chromosome, and flanking genes
          that show monoallelic expression (only one is being used)

          * perhaps one of the LINE families is used in the silencing
            of the extra copy of X in XX individuals    

            * ICF ( mutation in methelation system used in silencing )

      * SINEs 1.5M 13%

        * too short to encode their movement protein (instead uses
          components from LINEs)
        * certain SINE elements use LINE elements
        * in humans Alu uses L1 machinery to move around

          * L1 seen at GC rich regions, Alu in AT, which is confusing
            considering Alu uses L1 machinery
            new Alu transposition events are in same as L1 
          * the preference seems to come from how they mutate with
            time 

        * MIR uses L2
        * imprinted genes seem to have reduction of SINEs

      * Retrovirus-like 450,000 8%

        * has LTR structure
          - LTR Gag Pol Env LTR ->
        * may or may not have Env gene

          * if you have env gene, can leave the cell and propagate as a
            virus
          * retrovirus phase has much higher mutation rate
            * copying is error prone
          * uncertain if there are any RV-like transposons are moving,
            many say no
          * historical mutations of one RV family (look at inner branches
               of tree

            * few stop codons introduced
            * reduction of non-synonymous mutation vs synonymous
            * mutation rate of Env gene doesn't seem higher
              (perhaps some are leaving genome and living as viruses)

      * DNA-Transposons 300,000 3%

        * protein needs to find a copy in genome
        * means that as time progresses and number of broken copies
          increase the DNA transposons tend to die off

      * usually retrotransposons are thought of in eukaryotic cells

        * prokaryotics have complety different system
        * found in Myxobateria

          * some e.coli also has one (though common lab strains randomly
            didn't have copy

      * main things to know about transposons

        * are they still active
        * how long have they existed

* horizontal transmission of genes

  * very controversial section of human genome draft paper
  * may be other copies in other eukaryotes that aren't commonly
    studied
  * some best blast hit can be  misleading, doesn't mean the best hit is
    closest phylogenetically
