Gene transfer and gene therapy

* huntingtons disease, has ethical issues well worked out. ELSE
  * paper to read on ethical legal social issues

* Triplet repeat diseases (cont)

  * many of these triplet repeat disease show mitotic and meiotic
    sources.
    * B cells show an increase on repeats even above the rest of their
      tissues. 

* Myotonic Dystrophy
  
  * different drugs are needed to treat each of the phenotypes.
  * highly variable age of onset and severity
  * 4 mechanisms have been proposed, and it seems like there's
    evidince that there are really are 4 different mechanisms

    * RNA processing defect, defect is in the 3' UTR, leads to
      defective protein & less protein. 

      * unprocessed RNA tends to build up and become toxic in the
        nucleus

    * Repeat structure alters local chromatin structure affecting
      nearby genes and their expression 
    * CUG repeats interact with RNA binding proteins to alter normal
      activity of RNA binding proteins
    * CUG repeats in RNA can serve as  binding sites for a subset of
      DNA binding proteins that include specific transcription factors
  
      * in general RNA can bind up and look like a hairpin but usually
        isn't a good binding site.

  * experimental approaches to test these there possibilities
  
    * altered splicing.
      * detected by transcript mapping - retention and accumulation of incorrectly spliced form within the nucleus
      * result is less mRNA at stead state in cytoplasm to be translated
      * therefore less wild-type protein: raises question of dosage.  So ask what does mouse heterozygote vs homozygous deletion look like
      * not infrequently the knockout mouse model doesn't express the
        same phenotype
      * in the mouse model of the myotonic dystrophy

        * heterozygous knockout - mouse has no muscle phenotype
        * homozygotes 
          * mild skeletal myopathy in adult
          * no cataract
          * good phenocopy of cardiac conductance deficit
          * partial recapitualation of human at best and only in
            homozygotes

    * neighborhood position effect variegation (through chromotain
      alterations perhaps)?

      * Is there a specific candidate gene?

        * yes SIX5 - transcription regulatory gene

      * how to test? Do a knockout of SIX5 in mouse

        * many of the earlier knockout techniques in the 80s and 90s
          have other effects because the selection casset was left in
          place. can have a profound impact on nearby genes
        * review paper describes this hypothetical problem
        * Cre-Lox system is useful because you can remove the
          selection cassette

      * after knockout...

        * no muscle phenotype
        * recapitulation of cataract phenotype in both homo &
          heterozygotes

   * Toxic gain of function

     * mouse model is transgenic carrying gene encoding RNA with a
       high copy repeat
     * design so repeats embedded in an actin RNA not a DMPK RNA,
       instead in actin
     * Result myotonia & myopathy phenocopy of human disease

   * supporting evidence from cultured cell studies

     * high CUG repeat transcripts accumulate in foci within the
       nucleus of transfected cells
     * High CUG repeat RNA inhibit muscle differation
     * Protein that preferentially binds to CUG RNA CUG-BP1 is implicated in
       RNA procesing
     * Hairpin structure formed by high CUG rna activates a double
       stranded RNA dependendent kinase called PKR (its targets are presently unknown)

   * All four hypotheses may be correct in some degree, leads to
     additive model of myotonic dystrophy

   * Consider DM2 locus on chromosome 3

     * has all diverse features of DM phenotype, including
       anticipation (4 base sequence repeat CCUG?, also has a couple
       of other spots that can expand) expands in first intron instead
       of 3' UTR.
     
       * phenocopies almost all of the DM1 locus, not even a kinase
         it's a zinc finger transcription protein

* ELSI ethical legal social implications
  
  * insurance DNA knowledge vs family history
  * who wants to be tested
  * implication of 20 year old child being tested for 40 year old
    parent who doesn not want to know

    * you should have the right not to know

* Cancer genetics

  * somatic

    * oncogenes - 

      * tend to be more of a somatic problem. 
       
        * Kras, Hras, N-ras

          * point mutations that break kinases? (missed details)
          * has a viral heritage

        * C-Myc N-Mycs
        
          * transcription factors, upstream of a varity of cell 
          * gene dosage effect, achieved through amplification

            * HSRs - homogenous staining region, many copies of a gene
              and its neighbors

          * neuroblastoma, amplification of N-myc, 100s of copies
          * other tumors have C-myc activated only about 10 fold
          * other ways of upping dosage, translocation
           
            * fuse Ig-NIRD (non immuglobin rearanged dna), discovered
              to be c-myc
            * happens in B cell and fuses the coding region of c-myc
              to immunioglobin - burkintte lymphoma
            * fusion of Forkhead with PAX3/7 rhabdomyocarcoma

              * arrise in muscle progenitor cells
            
  * germline

    * tumor suppressors - 

      * negative regulators of cell proliferation

        * P16/ARF is a Cdk inhibitor

          * tumor supressor for familial controls
          * has frameshift overlapping coding regions

        * Retnal blastoma 
    
          * when both eyes are mutated you can now it was inherited 
          * RB is expressed in many other cells but only has the
            cancer phenotype in the retina. (Loss of function that
            leads to the tumor)
          * Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) 

            * point mutation
            * chromosome segregation
            * mitotic recombination (big 
            * epigenetic (methylation, chromosomal silencing)

              * environmental issues for some genes 
              * some aerosols e.g. p53 in lung cancer

         * p53 is a checkpoint mediator, important in many cancers

           * regulates Bcl2 ( families of proteins regulating
             apoptosis )

      * neg regulators of negative regulators of apoptosis
      * DNA repair
      
        * BRCA1, BRCA2 responsible for familial breast/ovarian cancer, 
          but not for sporadic cancer. Risk assessment
          
          * BRCA1 - 85% by 80 years
          * BRCA2 - lower penatrance for breast, but much higher for
            ovarian 

  * philidelphia chromosome

    * generates chronically active ABL tyrosine kinase
    * has highly effective drug
    * worked out by david baltimore in the early 80s
    * glevac, inhibits this kinase
      
      * thought it was specific, but wasn't
      * if they'd known more they wouldn't have tested it.

  * what to know

    * know what's an oncogene/tumor suppressor
    * what changes to mutate cell e.g. the LOH section
