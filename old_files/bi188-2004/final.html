</center>

<p>You have 3 hours to take the exam

<p>Answer 5 of the 7 questions

<p>You can answer one extra question for extra credit.  Be sure to clearly
mark which question you will be answering for extra credit.

<p>The exam is open note, but closed internet.  You can use the resources on 
the course web site such as the notes and references, but not the links.  
e.g. You can not go to OMIM.

<p>The final is due by 5pm on Thursday, June 3.  You can submit it electronically to Tracy (tracyt at caltech.edu) or put it in the box outside 128 Kerckhoff.  We encourage you to type your responses, so that we can read them more easily.  However, blue books will also be allowed.

<p>Good luck!
