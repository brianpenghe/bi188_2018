S. Scherer lecturing

can learn a lot given just the sequence alone
who cares how the sequence made, where it came from, etc.

sequence analysis: 
* statistical analysis
* alignment algs
* gene prediction
  * find where the genes are
    * clear ideas about what works & doesn't


'''statistical analysis'''

base composition
comes up over and over again

various issues, e.g.
* too much GC -> too hard to sequence
* not enough GC, difficult to clone (E. coli doesn't like it)

when looking at two strands:

  A = T   (i.e. concentrations of A = conc. of T)
  G = C   (i.e. concentrations of G = conc. of C)

but not true if looking at one strand

Locally they don't have to be true

prokaryotic DNA 

plot (C-G) / (C+G)  

versus the whole genome, e.g.:

e.coli   across genome

  |
0 |  ----        ----
  |      --------

                 ^
                 |
                 |
              is here
origin of replication

so why does 1/2 the genome have more C's (vs. G's)?

which side the genes are transcribed from?

around origin there IS strand bias

most of excess Cs and Gs are in the 3rd codons
but still not straightforward

what can you say about dinucleotide 
nearest neighbor analysis
first done to explain strands are antiparallel 
(not confident of previous statement)

observed value less than expected value

"there is some biology going on"

C's are often methylated

leads to mutogenesis

CG's are special

CG == GC

clustered in CPG islands 

isolated ones are methylated all the time

others in islands are not so methylated, usually involved in regulation

C - methylation
yeast does not do methylation (modern) , though once they believed it did
but yeast doesn't have as much cg as expected if it doesn't do methylation?

(Joe is not sure if I got all the methylation stuff above correct!)

genome project forces everyone to do the same thing
maybe an onld artifact?

in areas you find are GC rich, you'll observe more CGs than expected

1. 500bp of 55% G+C

2. look at CG nucleotides
   obsserved
   --------  > 0.65
   expected

3. want at least 7 CG dinucleotides in this region
   to avoid trivial 

higher-order oligonucleotides

trinucleotides or tetranucleotides

sequences are not random
some biology in the shorter sequences

bulk statistics of tetranucleotides:
does all human DNA look alike?  how are 

can you identify DNA that doesn't belong e.g. in Human?
horizontal transmission, transposition, biology, 
genes that belong there but don't look like the other genes?

we're good at look like things that we know what they look like
but not as good at discovery, things just anomalous

bulk sequence, look at all possible hexanucleotides
interesting biology happens when you look but find too few things 

why wouldn't find tetranucleotideGATC
symmetrical sequences tend not to be 

in e.coli, GATC, A gets methylated

sites for restriction enzymes, how many should be is less than 
there aught to be

particular sequences, esp. symmetrical

GTAC also underrepresented in most bacteria

trinucleotides & codon usage
should be straightforward, but still some interesting biology
multiple codons can code an amino acid

in particular organisms, some preferred to others 

e.g. from [ endacolimin ? ] (spelling?)  (some simle organism)

6 columns:
TEF3
EN01
HSP70 = heat shock protein
TRL1
MKC1 = map kinase
PKC1 = protein kinase C


by 4 rows: 

CCT  3  1  5  7  6 11
CCC  0  0  0  5  5  3
CCA 38 16 22 15 11 28
CCG  0  0  0  2  2  7

look at codon bias, adaptation index  (CAI)

works well on proteins with widely varying AA 
also of varying length

look at ith Amino Acid 

 AAi

 codon J

 X is how many times used in abundantly expressed protein

 Wid = Xij / Xi  max

weight by the one used the most

for the one occuring the most, divide by itself, weight factor is 1

geometric mean

 CAI = (  PI  range 1:L  of Wn  ) rasied to 1/L

plus minor adjustment ot the rows so 0 doesn't zero whole thing

the number for different organisms:

2 columns: 
 yeast 
 e.coli

CCT   .047  .007
CCC   .009  .012
CCA  1.0    .135
CCG   .002 1.0

for these 4 codons

often run into issues in the lab because of codons not preferred 
dep. on the genome

there's reasonable predictive value from codon usage

cells can get amplification by translation being efficient, don't have
to amplify trancription

save production of mrna

why are there codon biases at all?

what codons get chosen and why?

base composition in bacterial world, varys over wide range
70% GC,  others 20% gc

how do change in base composition?

genes packed in wall-to-wall, all coding region
can only change 3rd position in codon??? almost true

make a strange graph
x axis: %GC content (per organism)
Y is use of G in each of 3 positions
  1st position how often use G?
  2nd position how often use G?
  3rd position how often use G?

in 3rd position in GC rich organism, lots in those, not surprising 

orgs are also changing usage in position in 1st two positions as well.

base composition in genome is chnging, change which 
AA they're usin gto make proteins
not big effect but 

rgene vs. lysene sustitute one for the other   (spelling?)

adenine vs. valene   (spelling?)

organism can't change some
but can change composition

sequence alignment
------------------

everything you need to know about sequence alignment you can learn from 
dot plots

e.g. compare 2 retroviruses related to each other

             seq 2
       *                   *
         *                   *
           *                   *
             * 
seq 1             *
                    *
                      *
      *
        *
          *

can make up some rule about base pair relationships
e.g. 1  pair match?   2 pairs match?
if so, dot appears..

Are all dots equal???  
yes, more if it's a protein

rules for deciding how much dots are worth

21st century, also for connecting the dots

terminal repeats also, explained in corners

issues about best vs. good

substitution matrices, scoring rules, damage for misses
rules for opening up gaps, 

scores for alignments, to judge one vs. another

smith-waterman
vs. brute force try every alignment

switch over to talk about blast
how it gets the right anwer virtually all of the time.
then run smith-waterman on the end to get a better answer

also fasta for historic interest
found points on the diagonal, then put diagonals together
45degree lines, connect

scoring rules first
for nda sequences are boring, turn into simple matrices
unit matrix
the scoring rules for aligning protein sequences matter a LOT

that's the only thing that matters compared to everything else
when blast first developed, used substitution matrices, +/- 
to score match/mismatch

PAM matrices, nice idea, didn't work as well as current
closely related proteins
what mutationsa re toloerated
point-  mutations..

more than 85% identical, what substitutions are acceptable

single mutations not double mutations

more distantly related proteins, see what remains conserved, 
that works better

blocks database, 
aligned, conserved regions

big table

a protein sequence

    A   G   Y   W

in a related protein

    A   G   F   W

another

    G   G   Y   W


enormous tables

all pairwise combinations, across all positions

make a table of pair matches observed, e.g. 

 AA  GG  YF  WW  
 AG  GG  FY  WW

frequency of usage of pairs, 

 Fij

then from frequencies can get probabilites  

 Qij = Fij / sigma over i (sigma over ij j<=i  Fij ) )

probability of seeing any pairs

single amino acid amonxt all of these pairs

probability of a pair

probability of a single Amino Acid  (AA)

 Pi  e.g. probability of an A being in this table

 Pi = Qii + sigma over j!=i  of Qij)  / 2    

over 2 because only half of the pair is comprised of the A.

what do we expect, what do we see, take a log ratio


can get expectation, Eij  = Pi Pj  (j=i)
or Eij = 2 Pi Pj  (J != i)

  now multiply back by factor of 2

then calculate an entropy

shows up in many context... 

take log of odds ratio      ("odds ratio???")

 Sij = log2 (Qij / Pij)

positive or negative number

number of bits

multiplied by 2 and rounded to nearest integer

but these are the entropies.

Units of 1/2 bits

older dna searches, blast scores & bit scores, differ by 
factor of 2, and that's the reason.

these multiplied by 2 to match old PAM matrices, that's the difference


to score a particular substitution

how changing the rules for which things to put in the table 
affects how the whole process works...

can get different numbers out the other end.

start with distant sequences and see which parts are conserved
if table is human and chimp, vary by 1 or 2 AAs, not a lot of info.


Pentacoff did 10+ years ago, made a rule if 2 proteins differ 
by less than a certain %, then average their contributinos to this 
table. they won't count as much, fewer things to work with to make 
the table, but won't be over-weighted by too-close 

calculate an entropy not for an individual substitution but for the 
whole matrix

sum over all amino acids, 

 H = sigma i (sigma J<=i  of QijSij)

get a number, use to say how much info is in this structure 
we're producing; 

what happens when change rules for how closely related things can 
be in the table, how it changes H, the relative entropy, i.e. 
information content, the whole ball of wax...

plot (not reproduced in my notes)
2 y axes:
  Left:  H  0.4, 0.8, 1.2
  right: total base pairs available  (10E5, 10E6, 10E7)
X axis: 
  % clustering

how's it affect how the searches come up?

which search results are right, and which are wrong?

do better than 99.5% percentile of junk/fake/bogus matches; 
a real match has to score better than that.


blosum 0.62 relative entropy point, 
get minimum average number of entries missed
how often you're missing things

if you construct matrices right, you'll miss the least

blast vs. fasta vs. s/w

blosum matrices doo it a little less
if build scoring rules in sensible way, 

find distant relationships, build rules out of them, 
the more reasonable way

now that we have scoring rules, have to align sequences

align globally or locally

First: global, start at one end, try to get to the other

Next: local, try to get best score over local region

e.g. Human and chimp e.g. betaglobin genes

vs. 

e.g. 2 yeast genes which separated 100M years ago

local align is trivial case of the global alignment algorithm

2 prot seq's

    F    L    L
F  +1    0   -1
Fj  0    0   -1
K  -1   -1   -1
L  -2    0    0 

match, gain a point
don't match, lose a point
gap, lose a point

muliple paths to same point, record/save only the best path for transition
move down or left 1 unit, open a gap, cost a point
move diagonally, 

looking for A best score, not THE best score
recording all paths to each point doesn't matter, just "best"

global alignment, from bottom corner of graph, trace a path 
back to the top left corner, a best solution

global: always path from bottom right corner to the origin
  - one gap, one mismatch
smith waterman, stop at a zero to open a gap

gapping rules crucial
once opened up sequence, sticking in 100 AA's isn't different than opening 
3 AA's.  different rules for opening & extending, 
have to check back to other places, 

computationally can be brutal

can be implemented in hardware

as sequences get large, 
table is square of length of sequences
millions of bases long is unfeasable!!!
fortunately any outer-bound of matrix is function of next row in.
only need something a little off diagonal to 


blast
basic local alignment search tool
- talking about local alignments
try to take advantage of a little biology to speed the math along a lot

dot plot
rare when 2 seq's align and are bio-related, that the mtches 
are uniformely distributed along the length
usually peices that match well, plus others.
rare that matches & mismatches are uniform.

use the few dots that are close together to start the search
a place where there are a few dots on the same diagonal, 
that the aggregate score is above some threshold score

a little piece that matches well, lookup table to make it fast, 
then go up the table 

original blast
look for threshold score, then extend
now
2 dots exceed score, that are not too far apart, then extend around there.

DNA done like proteins but with simpler rules

dna sequence, only 4 possibilities, can bit pack, if willing to require 
certain word boundaries for matches, 

now, modern blast, not only looks for points on diagonal, but 
if found a few over in another area, if 2 diagonals don't line up, 
will apply smith-waterman over a bigger region, within area of 
graph having slightly-off diagonal alignments, then run S/W over 
that to find the best

what do you expect to find?

AA match by chance?
seuqence 20 genomes, pile more stuff on, have some match, 
what's probability of finding a match by chance?  Higher since 
adding more stuff.  Biology hasn't changed but statistics have, 
so take gene vs. yeast genome, get a probability; then search 
against EVERYTHING, probability of seing by chnace grows, but 
it doesn't change underlying biology



Gene Finding
------------

in large genomic sequences

doing it now, but need to do better

in bacteria, simle ORFs, look for them, done
ribosome binding site up front, stop codon in back, operon, 
not too hard.  almost everything is a gene anyway.

some genes spread over wide range, hard in 

rather than historic perspective, intro to contemporary way...

given sequence, e.g.: 

  ATATCTGATATGATTCGGTCCTAGCCGGCAAGGCAAGATCAAAGA

regular markov model vs. hidden

regular markov: transition to next base...

but hiding one fact: new there was an A there, so knew what 
to lookup next.

At any given point, don't know which it is, 
2 matrices of probabilities... 
1 says what are the odds of switching states
e.g. intron & exon, prob of switch based on what we see.
2x2 matrix of transition probabilities
from 1 state to another

2nd set is:
if in particular state, what are odds of observing the DNA 
sequence 

exon higher prob of G&C
intron higher prob of A&T

try out all possibilities, see which is the most likely

switch back & forth 

try all possible switches that occur, then try all possible things
and knowing proabilities for observing transitions, which is most likkely
then call that our gene model

but of course we have other states as well, e.g. 

promotor or not?
5'UTR or not?
3'UTR or not?
5' splice junction?
3' splice junction?

Genscan or derivatives use:
20 odd states

some transitions not allowed:
e.g. 3'UTR -> 5'UTR not allowed

some other things algorithm uses can cut down on the work as well

basic thing they teach you in vegas is dice don't have memory.
but in this process, memory matters!

e.g. intron size matters
if too long, doesn't splice efficiently
thus need duration model
transition models not surprisingly depend on the base composition
one basic feature of our dna: if GC rich, introns smaller
if AT rich, introns get larger

so genome bp statistics affect the transition probabilities

genscan designed to handle human genome project
arbitrary length sequence
decide if 1) no genes, 2) some number of genes

doesn't take care of overlapping genes
problem in bacterial world in particular
in bacteria it happens occasionally, 
in humans, less often

also doesn't handle alternative splicing

what's most probable set of pieces & how they go together.
not designed to give alternatives, like 2nd best 
alternative

dealing with splice juctions

when you have a 5' splice junction, you have a GT in 
positions +1 & +2.


   -3   -2  -1   +1   +2   +3   +4   +5   +6
A  33   60   8    0    0   49   71    6   15
C  37   13   4    0    0    3    7    5   19
G  18   14  81  100    0   45   12   84   20
U  12   13   7    0  100    3    9    5   46


the U1 RNA is comlementary to 5' splice junction

U1 suRNA:

3'  G    U    C   C   A   U   U   C  A   5'
             ***
decision tree actually to explain the options possible

6 bases, know 5, what's probability of 6th

different models depending on the base composition

when dealing with exons, need 1 more refinement
when going through exon...
1st position, 2nd or 3rd of the codon?
apply different models dep on which reading frame you can be in.

when exon, in which frame 1, 2 or 3?

poly-adenalation site

look for TATA boxes to see if you can find the promotor
but some genes don't have those, so need another model 
to help explain 

if you try out all of these tricks, do surprisingly well--- 
10-15% RIGHT, another 1/4 pretty good.

is one more piece of info available...
e.g. human sequence & mouse sequence.
how do incorporate into gene finding?
parts that match well are probably genes, don't match are not.

but a refinement to genscan:
have 2 seq's we can observe, so going along human sequence, 
done alignment to mouse, (there's a reference for how that's 
done).
Before 2 probabilities: 1 state to another, 
another 

now also need proability of getting the 2 sequences we see?

output sequence is not just the one.

Proability of T in intron, and T intron in comparison sequence, 
or G, or gap, or whatever.

Essence of modern gene finding: improve by looking at 2nd sequence
model produce alternative sequence ALSO, and see if reasonable 
as well...

all these things built on a model of how you think the world works.
But some genes don't work that way- you won't get them!!!
