Dr. Wold presenting

* Gene therapy, difficulties with
  * Beta thalasima, seemed like a possible test case 
    * tried to do the experiment in Israel. 
    * 25 years later, just starting to be cured though
  * Insertional mutagenesis
    * everything except for homologous recombination has chance for mutagenesis
      * disrupt gene
      * cis effects (disrupt regulation)
        * therapy for SCIDX1, solves immune problem while causing leukemia
      * homologous recombination works nicely in mice
        * recombination is inefficient in any model organism, problem for humans
          very low chances compared to random integration
          even in yeast you need to do a selection critera
          * ethical issues for humans
            * worldwide ban on germ line research
            * though its easier in the embryo than adult; hard to get at cell compartments,
later in life from a technological point of view, working in the embryo would be much easier
            * technically possible to do IVF and insert gene into blastocyst, select which one uptook the gene and then create new embryo from it.
        * many other cells will integrate it randomly anyway.
  * Target cell access
      * need to access a large enough number of cells to uptake
            gene and provide a selection pressure to filter out the
            cells without the modified gene.
  * Engineering apropriate place/amount of expression
      * need to express in the right cells at the right time in the right amount.  Could affect things badly if incorrect.
  * Permanance
     * if you miss the stem cell, the treatment will wear out
  * Immune rejection
     * presenting new protein can bring up immune response
            against targeted gene


* Beta thalassemia gene therapy
  * old goal not realized, first work 1979
  * hematopoetic lineage is favorable for gene therapy
    * self marrow transplants can be done well, although still dangerous - have to lethally radiate recipient to knock out native maroow, kill off diseased cells and make an environment with a ot of space for new cells to take hold, lots of problems - no immune system, platelets 
  * getting gene expressed in physiological amounts in right cells but
    not others is a challenge
  * LCR (locus control region)
    * operationl definition without a complete molecular definiton
    * site in DNA that covers 12 kb, has number of transcription
      factors, chromitin is permanently remodeled within the LCR,
      acts at a distance, on the order of 60 kb.
      * LCR seems to control the total amount of transcription,
        protects against position effects.
  * Lentiviral vectors
    * can only integrate into cell
    * though there's an issue about whether or not virus can recombine
      with a currently viable virus and make a new super virus
    * lentivirus has limitations on total payload size
    * cd34 seems to target largely hematopoetic progenitor cells
    * lentivirus can integrate into a cell that is not currently going
      through cell cycle, other retroviruses can't

* Gene therapy mediated insertional mutagenesic hazard
  * SCIDX1 severe combined imuni deficiency disorder
  * codes for gamma-c cytokine receptor subunit common chain in
    recepters for IL2,4,7,9,15 needed for survival, growth, differentiation of early immune progenitors
  * the retrovirus for this study was a murine maloney retroviral vector
    * the LTR also codes to for something that encourages the gene to
      be shut down probably by chromitin remodeling
  * Trial was done on two patients - 11 and 8 months old
    * Remove marrow and isolate CD34+ cells (~5 million cells)
    * get cells to start dividing in culture, (needed for the
      retrovirus)
    * infect repeatedly for 3 days with gammaC moloney virus
    * 3 year latency, 2 people developed lymphoblastoid leukemia
      T-cell leukemia
    * infuse ~2*10^7 cells/Kg body weight (Note: no irradiation of host.  Expect growth advantage to gamma-C positive cells.)
    * In these patients gene therapy was able to provide correction of disease phenotype and hence clinical benefit, both children could leave hospital and go home.

    * in two cases triggered LMO2 oncogenes - acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (3 years later)
      * LMO2 is transcription factor of progenitor cells
      * preclinical mouse trials did not reveal the risk
      * both patients with leukemia treated for leukemia and doing OK now
      * these patients had gotten ~10 times more cells than the others, will the others get it, or just get it later?

  * Insertional sites, biases, consequences
  * retroviruses insert "randomly"
    * but have preferential neighborhoods - open chromatin domains and explicit promoter regions are often favored

* Triplet repeat diseases
  * went through several explanations of how they worked
    * increasing severity with progression of generations = anticipation
  * molecular origins
    * putative replication slippage of repeats (apparent relation with microsatellite instability)
    * huntingtons was expansion in a protein coding region
    * myotonic dystrophy
      [[BR]]5-38 repeats is normal
      [[BR]]39-100 is mild disease alleal
      [[BR]]disease alleles is up to 2000 for the most severe

    
* For myotonic dystrophy - 4 current hypotheses
  * RNA processing defect leads to defective protein and less protein
  * Repeat structure alters local chromatin structure affecting near by genes and their expression
  * CUG repeats interact with RNA binding proteins to alter normal activity of RNA binding proteins (gumming-up-the-works notion) i.e. toxic gain of function
  * CUG repeats in RNA can serve as biding sites for a subset of DNA binding proteins that include specific transcription factors
