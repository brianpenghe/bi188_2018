Error in palindromic sequence in first lecture

* Human genetics 
  * Genetics requires 3 things
    * with all 3 you have a genetic system
    * mutants 
      * can't introduce mutations into human germ-line
    * complementation testing
      * can't arrange crosses
    * Linkage analysis
      * ?
  * human genetics isn't as hard at sounds
    * there are a lot of people -  yeast screens goes up to 10^8 individuals, about the population of the US
    * people are helpful because mutants are self-identifying.
      * people who have diseases will go to their doctor.
      * mutants ID themselves
    * Complementation testing
      * do everyone who has the disease have the same issue
      * good to use the same large family, preferably with long family histories 
    * human genetic techniques can transfer to other species
      * crops are high ploidy which makes mutant isolation hard
      * don't necessarily know the sexual reproduction of some species
      * trees have long generation times
    * statistics
      * most genetics texts have a great deal of statistics. (helped drive development of stats)
      * $\theta \implies$  recombination fraction varies between [0, .5]
      * Phase -> are the haplotypes known
        * heterozygous between two individuals
         m1a - m2a    
         [[BR]]m1b - m2b
      * LOD score (log of the odds score)
        * for the pedigree ith
          $Z(\theta, i) = log10 (F(i,\theta) / f(i, 1/2))$
          * 1/2 = unlinked trait
          * theta - proposed recombination fraction that your testing
          * f hides the biology, is it dominant, recessive, etc.
          * basically doing a weighted coin-toss

          $F \proportion \theta ^ x ( 1- \theta) ^ y$
          
          x is the number of crosses
          y parental types (# of generations?)

          LOD score can be positive or negative

{{{
            |        x
            |   x         x        < - $\theta = (x/x+y)$

            when theta = .5 z = 0


       * Example...
         Assume phenotype P, marker M, with double heterozygote
         with 10 kids, are they linked?

         5   Pa  Mb
         [[BR]]4   Pb  Ma
         [[BR]]1   Pa  Ma
         [[BR]]0   Pb  Mb
         
         not likely, as it seems Pa Mb and Pb Ma are linked on the chromosome

         test by using the formula, testing for the either combination
           5+4 = y
           [[BR]]1+0 = x   (in above formula)

         trying to compute probability of event happening, so add both possibilities together. 

This is for the simple case, gets more complicated as markers increase. 
[[BR]]Unfortunately data set is frequently incomplete which makes calculation more complicated. 
[[BR]]Also phenotype may be hard to score.

       * many traits are not discrete
         * quantitative traits are height/weight, blood pressure, etc.
         * eg simple model

           aa is bell curve with smallest mean
           [[BR]]Aa is medium mean
           [[BR]]AA is biggest mean
           [[BR]]Assume individual in the center of graph
           [[BR]]Can't really determine which group individual is in, but can determine likelihoods of membership in each class.

       * another way of doing it, parametric or model-free analysis
         * assume family with some number of progeny, 
         * affected individuals must share a common chunk of chromosome.

           (Observed - Expected) / std error 
           
           this formula is different from LOD score (different scale)

         * to do experiment need hundreds of markers

       * LOD scores, model greater than 3 tend to be accepted, reject less than -2 
         * cross validate looking at different models with the highest probability.
         * if you have a correct model it's more helpful than non-parametric 
         * non-parametric scores should probably be more than 4 to be suggestive 

       * following multiple markers will tax even the best computers today
       * best case, 100 % penetrance, dominant trait, needs a couple dozen
       * genetic maps for male or female meiosis does not look the same
       * how much recombination is present in the human genetics
         * centiMorgan = 100 million bp in humans
         * 3000 cover the human genome
         * using variable repeat markers are polymorphic everywhere
         * next question after determining linkage, is how many genes there are
         radically changed by genome project
         ( detailed map is now available )
         * textbook has a good analysis of haplotype analysis
         * eventually problem shifts from genetics to biology problem
           * if there are multiple polymorphisms, you can try and figure out which gene is broken by how much it makes sense

     * classic human polymorphisms
       * sickle cell 10% heterozygote
       * cystic fibrosis 3%
       * muscular dystrophy
         * x linked, large gene with many targets
       * LDL receptor south africa 1%
       * G6 PDH
       * Hemochromatosis, Briton has 10% are heterozygous for the gene
       * selection must happen at the heterozygotes as homozygotes can't change population.
       * main human selection pressure (historically)
         * infectious disease
         * eating

* human infections diseases
  * malaria
    * polymorphisms are geographically linked
    * has several stages in the human
      * takes place in liver, then blood, sexual reproduction happens in the insect
    * HbS - sickle cell heterozygotes are resistant to malaria
      * homozygotes HbS were barely viable.
    * Many hemoglobin alleles related to malaria resistance
    [[BR]]HbC is another. HbA is wild-type
      * how to design a study to see if a genotype helps provide resistance. 
        * check to see if the alleles are in harvey-weinberg equilibrium
        * problem is homozygotes is rare enough that it's hard to detect changes (variance of a number that's only 1%)
          * solution is to design a large study that counts thousands of people.
     * G6PDH receptor
       * geography is concordant with malaria
       * 300 alleles known
         * dozens above 1% throughout the population
       * in affected areas can find deficiencies greater than 10%
       * knockouts is a severe phenotype (anemia)
       * main source PDH, affecting reducing potential of cell
       producing different response with oxygen stress
       This one causes cell death which kills the parasite
     * MHC most variable gene allele in immune system
        * HL-A-Bw53
          severe malaria 16.9%  (hospitalized)
