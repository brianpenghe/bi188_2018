Bi 188

Handing out assignment next week
mck sequence comparison
to get familiar with blast, seq comariosn, working with gnomes
no grade just useful exercise
2 year ago paper was to look at a human genetic disorder.

* recommend reading: human genome paper
* reference genome seq 4/03
  * ~100 procaryotics done
    * mycoplasma, simplest smallest self-contained cell
  * "finished" means only a few gaps, errors in assembly
    recent duplication, 
  * chicken genome out, and would be useful compared to mammals
* sequenceing the human genome
  * working biologists didn't like the project 
  * Baltimore pushed for the idea of a reference single 

  * mel simone, hiraki ? invented the BAC to allow copying large 150 kb 
    chunk DNAs
    * needed to know replication of origin

  * celera's plan
    * much more aggressive
      * gene myers, had the idea for the algorithm but hadn't written
        them yet.  
      * use bidirectional information of a known distance (2k, 5k,
        10k, etc) apart to provide clues to deal with large repeats

  * sequencing
    * problem with polymorphic individuals 
    * MIT did 25 X converage of a ocean creature but couldn't assemble
      it with shotgun 
    * used the most inbred dog
    * is currently also looking for the most inbred elephant

  * genome browsers
    * 2 of them human, UCSC or Emble
    * shows multiple species
    * shows mRNA maps
    * the common gene name can be wrong and go to a different gene
      * sometimes same name is used for two different genes in two 
        different species
      * gene bank assession #, sequence & blast much more robust

    * CpG islands are under expressed overall, but tend to cluster
      around the start of promoters
      * there about 28,000 CpG islands for 22,500 protein coding
      regions
      * CpG is used in methylation, which helps open & close chromitin
    * human sequence
     * ~3% is coding region
       * small non-coding micro RNA counts have been climbing
       * humans show more opportunity for splicing and regulation than
         yeast
    * shows picture of repeats
      * repeat frequency insertion drop seems to indicate presence of
        genes 
    * terms
      * paralogous genes - similar to each other within a genome
        * questionable how similar a gene needs to be to be
         "paralogous", should also have similar functionality
      * orthologous genes - similar in different genomes
        * hard to tell which gene is the "true" orthologoues
      * homologous - 
      * % homology - used loosely to mean % similarity

    * gene averages
      * Biggest human gene known: dystrophin = 2.4 mb hnRNA
        * takes hours to transcribe
        * mRNA isn't that long (perhaps 6kb)
      * average gene 1600 bases
      * avg ORF 450 aa
      * average genomic extent ~30kb
      * avg density 11.1 genes/megabase
      * regulatory elements can be distant 100kb (can be on the other
        side of a gene)

    * gneomic agnostic tend to start with 1 chromosome
      * usually Y 21,22,19
        * because they're the smallest
        * 21 interest in downs syndrom
      * 19 is interesting ( shows map of human 19 to mouse syntenic regions)
        * high density
        * lots of  zinc finger, olfactory receptors (about 1/2)
        * last vomeronasal receptor to be found in huamn

    * shows mussa/FR plots
      * FR, red compliment, black, reverse compliment (joe heard the
        other)
      * mammals radiated 80-100 MY ago

      * single binding site isn't heavily selected against since it takes
        several site to define specificity

   * comparison in 3 diverse genomes
     * vertabrates seem to have moved to smaller uniform exons with
       big introns
     * flys, etc seem to like larger exons with small introns

   * functional group distributions by different species
     * cell-cell interactions
     * immune systems

   * chromosome rearrangements
   * comparative genomes
     * 30% of known human disease genes have candidate orthologs in
       yeast
     * chap 10, 11
